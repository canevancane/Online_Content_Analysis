"4th Systems is an electrical contractor out of Seattle WA that services electrical systems in residential, commercial and industrial applications. We came across Bulbs.com early this week and found that in their catalog they hosted products not very common amount the wholesale supplier communities which we found excited because it will accelerate our lead times on these products. We made our first order with Jim Racicot and he is one of the best reps to work with for sure at Bulbs.com. 10/10. So far we are impressed to work with them. "

But I decided to build a larger order because your prices on other bulbs were good.  But any change in my cart took multiple tries to get it changed in the totals.  And any mistake in the addresses, etc, also took multiple re-tries to change.  So I had to go back essentially to the cart view more times than I should have if the updates worked as they should."
"Melissa Christianson gave me exceptional customer service! I have a chandelier that casts shadows and could not find a bulb that would work for it, once my original incandescent bulb died.

Just as I feared we’d have to rewire the lamp to fit new bulbs or get rid of it, Ann Marie found a bulb that would work! Her response could’ve been that the original bulb had been discontinued and wasn’t available. Instead she looked a little further and found a good replacement. So helpful & nice at the same time!

"My Order of 07/28/23, two LED 48-inch ceiling fixtures, was delivered via FEDEX, on 08/03/23. Unfortunately, that shipment arrived seriously damaged. This circumstance was reported to Bulbs.com the following day, w/ less than stellar results! Bulbs' Specialist 'Sour Attitude' lived up to his name, being quite sour and flying exceptionally low. While he did accept my return, only if I paid return S&H charges; he refused to accept any responsibility for damages due to \"poor packing.\" Further, he advised that \"handling damage\" be addressed directly w/ FEDEX – Bulbs.com \"had no responsibility for the shipper's operations,\" despite the fact that the shipper is under contract to Bulbs for provision of such operations. As it turned out, return charges proved to be only a couple of $$ below the value of the two fixtures, thus return was not really an option to pursue. Neither was taking the matter to FEDEX. Those circumstances & conditions determined, it was decided to re-order my initial order. Said re-order was begun 09/20/23, along w/ an online chat session asking how the situation w/ the initial order might be avoided w/ the re-order. Customer Service Specialist Melissa answered the chat session query; asked the particulars of my re-order, which were explained; asked for the order number; etc, etc. After spending some time accessing initial order records, plus reviewing what she said were \"very confusing circumstances;\" Melissa came back on chat, stating \"This should not have ever happened! You should have been offered a replacement order at/during your first call! I will take care of that immediately! And all at no cost to you.\" Interspersed in the whole of this were her numerous apologies for Bulbs.com, along w/ apologies for the condition/circumstances of the initial order, as well as for the inconvenience I had experienced as a result. Towards the end of the chat session, Melissa was advised that should 'things' turn out as she said/directed, faith in the \"good name and standing\" of Bulbs.com would be restored to its former state,  given that I had determined re-order of the LED ceiling fixtures would be my very last from Bulbs.com, never, ever to be repeated – regardless/period! As the chat session progressed, much to my extreme surprise – and, near total astonishment – Melissa offered to \"walk the re-order over to shipping so that packing for S&H was handled correctly and that re-order shipping was expedited.\" She further advised 'Sour Attitude' was no longer employed at Bulbs.com, promptly sending me an email explaining the preceding in entirety. Her email included additional info to the effect that she had, in fact, 'walked the replacement order over,' had, w/ assistance from the Bulbs' Warehouse Manager, both personally overseen replacement order product selection, and assured me the manager personally was packing the order. She further asked that she be kept informed as the replacement order progresses to its –satisfactory– conclusion.  Needless to say, Melissa has done exactly as she intended. She has more than lived up to her title of 'Service Specialist.' If 'things' proceed as she has set up, Bulbs.com will return to my 'A' list of 'up to the mark' suppliers/providers of lighting and related products. Thus, Melissa is, solely and completely, responsible for restoring Bulbs.com's \"good name and standing.\" For her support/assistance/help, she receives my most profound gratitude. She, is w/out doubt, the very best Customer Service Representative I have ever had the pleasure of encountering! Many thanks, Melissa, for your indeed phenomenal assistance! You go, girl! 👏 👏 👏"

A very satisfying and efficient purchasing experience."
"I placed an order for 4 bulbs, ($70) and got the wrong ones. Paid for shipping which was $15 and when I inquired about returning, they sent me a code which I figured pertained to a shipping label, which it didn't. It was $30 to ship them back. I asked again about the shipping explaining it was $30 to ship them back they sent me shipping label and said they will deduct another $15 from my refund. I'm up to $60 in shipping for bulbs I'm not going to use at this point. I contacted them again, trying to tell them not to charge me an additional $15 because in my previous emails as I explained I already spent $30 to ship them. I can go on and on about the back and forths with this company but hopefully you can see the hassles that accompanied me ordering and trying to return a wrong item. Just go to a local hardware store, bring your bulbs in and have them take care of all the ordering, you will save so much time and stress."

While I didn't have much engagement during the buying process, I unfortunately had to reach out because I didn't receive the correct order. I was missing a few things.When I ended up reaching out, the customer service rep did a fantastic job. I came in pretty heated, I'll be honest, but was quickly calmed and assured that I would have my order issues addressed, and they were. I guess the reason for my stress was that we were about to move into our new place and needed some final touches.I will definitely be ordering from them again and thank the customer service rep I spoke to for dealing with my frustrations and making everything right in the end."

I called the number and a gentlemen answered and said i will be right out to see what you have.

"I found bulbs.com online while I was looking for some lighting fixtures that were not available in the quantity I needed from my local lighting/electrical supply store.  I contacted customer service online with some questions, and Nick Susko got back with me immediately.  He was knowledgeable and checked on availability for me. He was able to have the fixtures drop-shipped directly from the manufacturer and I had them in 2 days!  The price was right in line with my contractor rate locally and the shipping was free.  Fast forward a few weeks, in the middle of installation, we encountered what we thought was asbestos in the ceiling.   The homeowner sent a sample for testing.  In the meantime I contacted Nick about a possible return of most of the fixtures, pending the outcome of the testing.  He was absolutely willing to work with me, and put my mind at ease about the possible return even though it was past the return policy date.  I don't think I have ever had such amazing customer service locally...let alone online, and my very first order!  In the end, it wasn't asbestos and we went ahead with the installation and did not need to return the fixtures.  I'd like you to know that Nick is an amazing asset to your company, and that I will continue ordering supplies through him as needed.  Thank you!"

I understand things are slow because of COVID, but I am currently waiting for an order I placed 26 days ago to arrive, and the site says tracking information is unavailable.  Thankfully, this is a restocking order, but if this order was time sensitive, I would be in a bind."

"Bulbs.com is a great company, they have the best pricing and service!"
"You can never go wrong with BULBS.COM"

Researched Watts, Lumens and Kelvin and had no idea what I was doing.  Found Bulbs.com at 4:50pm on a Thursday afternoon and called the toll free number.  Duy Truong picked up and was very patient with my light bulb ignorance and helped me find the right bulb for me.  He was professional, very kind and very helpful.  I ended up not needing the bulbs recommended (seems I wasn't letting the ones I had warm up enough before using) but will always remember how well I was treated.  Well done Duy!"
"Have been ordering from Bulbs.com for several years.  They provide excellent customer service, excellent products and ship quickly."
"Representative Bill Harvey is always very helpful and the bulbs arrive very quickly.  Great service!"
"Will look for another vendor.  I am a repeat commercial customer,   sales agent tried to rip me off with a high price w/out letting me know there was a large difference in price.  He will not answer my calls, will only work my email .  Funny when I was able to get thru to cust. service they were able to reduce my price drastically.  He was trying to rip me off.  I will look at another vendor for future orders."

"I was replacing the florescent tubes in a few old 4 tube T-12 office light fixtures. The non-shunted tombstones were brittle, some burned and several were chipped out. Since I had to strip out everything and rebuild the fixture, I  changed out the two T-12 ballasts with one T-8 ballast (easy enough) but I was stuck to find shunted tombstones with the wiring port configuration that I needed. Fortunately, bulbs.com had exactly what I needed at very reasonable pricing. The order arrived earlier than expected and I was able to complete the job to everyones satisfaction."
"ONLY RECIEVED 2 BULBS but the reminder is in transit."
"very seamless transactions...bulbs arrive on time and are exactly what i ordered!"
"Ordering from bulbs.com is easy to navigate. Have found bulbs I’ve looked for in other stores and online places .. not naming names. Bulbs.com has always come through for me with exactly what I’m looking for. Including the old fashioned incandescent “ filament” Edison bulbs. The only reason for the four instead of the five is because a few times bulbs have come broken . Quickly replaced though. It just seems to me if packaging were modified just a wee bit , this issue would go away , would save the company time and money in the long run and make for more five star reviews. Other than this , Bulbs .com is my go to for quality bulbs , hard to find bulbs , everyday common bulbs ... and at a better price than I’ve found anywhere else. Shipping is quick , service Representatives if you need them are pleasant and knowledgeable. I heartily recommend . Happy , satisfied customer here."
"Our agent Austin is excellent!  Great customer service, always has the answers and quickly calls back when I leave a message.  Bulbs arrive promptly also."

"They have had all my lighting needs. Fast service!"
"Website is user friendly and logical.  I was quickly able to place my order.  Delivery was quick and exactly as advised."
"Excellent selection of bulbs that places like Home Depot don’t carry. I like Soft White LED’s and not only did they have 25 4” spots I needed I received them in 2 days."
"Duy was a great help to our company!! Helped me order the correct bulbs and was awesome to work with, very friendly. Thank you for everything. We would buy from this A+ company again!!"
"Always a pleasure to work with Jim Fitzpatrick."
"The decorative bulbs I bought had ugly labels. Returning them, I had to pay for shipping both ways and a restocking fee. (This is why everyone buys from Amazon these days.) Product reviews on their website are broken, so I couldn't warn others about the label. I asked their \"live chat\" about the problem with writing reviews, and then they went silent."
"These are good bulbs.  They don't last as long as I would like but this is the only place I can find them. overall good service and quick delivery."
"Bulbs.com immediately contacted me and corrected the packaging error by shipping new bulbs which I received in good condition due to proper packaging. Previous review.   I purchased approximately 32 inch 75 watt UV bulbs which were shipped in a large box rather than a tube.  The large box was crushed during shipping and 2 bulbs were completely snapped.  Bulbs.com should not have shipped the bulbs without protective tube packaging.  A common carrier will obviously crush a large mostly empty box during the shipping process.  This is bulbs.com fault for not shipping properly."
"Order for hard-to-find-bulb was easy to place, shipped quickly, and was packaged well.  Will use them again."
"overall an excellent company. Jared is very professional and knowledgeable, looking forward to doing business with him in the future. Speedy shipments."

"Our Rep Nick Susko was extremely helpful in coordinating the shipment of bulbs we needed for our warehouse. He was able to save us money with the Mass Save program. We have always received great customer service with this company. Will not order bulbs from anyone else."
"Excellent representative over the phone.  Bulbs came relatively quickly and were packaged very safely.  Bulbs were easy to install and I love the look that I will be placing another order very soon!"
"Great online ordering and great customer service. Prompt and professional."
"EASY WEBSITE TO USE; GOOD PRICES; QUICK DELIEVRY OF IN-STOCK ITEMS"
"I am in charge of ordering lightbulbs for our seafood restaurant. I always go back to Bulbs.com because they take care of me. Their website is so easy to navigate and customer service is A-1. Great products, fast shipping, ease of ordering, wonderful selection, and super customer service. What more could you ask for?"
"I originally ordered recessed lights from another company, and that company let me know that the item was on backorder and told me that I wouldn't get them until later in March.  I found them in stock with bulbs.com and called to confirm stock.  I was told that 10 were in stock, but that they typically get stock in a few days after and they should ship soon after.  I ordered on 3/1 online and I received the 10 that were in stock, but I emailed on 3/9 when I didn't get a shipping notification for the remaining lights and was then told it wouldn't be until the 19th that they would get them in stock.  The 19th came and went and then I was then told they wouldn't get the lights until April 2nd.  I was told that this was due to the pandemic and the effect it has had on the supply chain.  I get that, but Bulbs.com should not give false expectations to its customers.  Other retailers and manufacturers are disclosing up front the supply chain problem.  Even on the order page, bulbs.com states \"typically ships within 3-7 business days\" for backordered items.  They also state \"We may already have more on the way or, in most cases, we can ship directly from the manufacturer.\"  In my case these were false statements that gave me the wrong expectation.  Additionally, their customer service agents reassured me that my order would be shipped sooner.  The supply chain issues have been occurring for awhile now, and in my case bulbs.com gave that as a reason only when the order went bad.  Bulbs.com: please improve your messaging and manage customer expectations better.  I went back to the original company and they will be sending me the lights by this Friday.  I have 40+ other light fixtures that I will need for our remodel in the coming weeks and I will shop elsewhere.  In the end Bulbs.com did not admit to their poor communication.  They said they were sorry that I was upset and that they would be \"happy to cancel and refund this order...\"  I think this was a poor choice of words for providing good customer service.  Normally I can handle delays, but in this case we have had to reschedule with our electrician multiple times.  I still have not received a refund."
"All was great except did not deliver on march 20 as indicated    Did not deliver till 3 23 2021      Its not your fault but maybe contact fed ex and ask for a refund as prrpmised  delivery did not happen"
"I called your toll free number and spoke to a very knowledgeable representative. He was able to guide me in purchasing the right bulbs for my fixtures, as my original bulb was discontinued. There are so many variables, and he was able to get them right. Shipping was fast and packaging was secure. Thanks!"
"System did not register the correct number for address. Eventhough I sent an email informing of this immediately, and received confirmation from customer service. Item was still sent to the wrong address.Have been waiting over one week to get resolved. Still no solution."
"Found the t5 safety lamps here on Bulbs.com. Speedy delivery and a great price."
"Excellent service from Bulbs.com.  I will buy from them again."
"bulbs were reasonably priced and shipping was fast. received my order in less than a week."
"My only issue with this purchase was that I had an extremely difficult time trying to make a tax-exempt purchase, without being an established customer. Since this was possibly a one-time purchase, I don't need to have an account, but I do need the purchase to be tax-exempt as I'm reselling the purchase. I'm not sure that I have gotten through to customer service yet, as to my need. I haven't seen the tax refund yet, so I'm thinking not."
"I found what I wanted. I placed an order at what seemed like a very competitive prices. It was easy to place the order. Delivery was prompt and I had no problems."
"I bought exterior LED retrofit bulbs for some pole and flood lights in our yard.  Sales was informed and helped talk me through my purchase on the phone, as well as making sure I bought the right voltage (I've made that mistake before).  The ordering process was quick and the bulbs arrived faster than expected---three working days.  Seven days after ordering, the bulbs are in place and look great!"
"I had ordered bulbs and they didn't show up, I am correcting a 1 star review to a FIVE STAR! They called me, apologized, very sincere, and sent new bulbs out and I got them the next day. GREAT JOB! Things happen but they happily corrected everything. Thank you"
"Quick and easy website.   Fast shipping.  Excellent packaging.  Thank you!"

"I am an electrical contractor. My man Jared L. Finds what I need and keeps me coming back to order more."
"I paid more than $200 to get the items delivered the next day and one was received 2 days later and the other one 4 days later. Why pay so much then? At least give a refund"
"Finding the right lightbulb is NOT as easy as one thinks!  Bulbs.com has a great quiz to use to find the right lighting for the right lamp.  Definitely will be ordering from Bulbs.com!"
"Freight!  Months!!"
"Excellent Sales and Service...Kevin Woods took the time to explain my options and helped me process my order. Once place the bulbs arrived within two days and we installed them.

"Wonderful customer service.Received  a damaged bulb and they took care of it promptly!  Will continue to purchase from this company."
"I have always been very happy with the website,  customer service,  and their products."
"Bulbs.com has a great variety of products on an easy-to-navigate web site.  It is easy to place an order.  Unfortunately they take a looooonnnggg time to ship your order and there is no way to find out why an order stays \"In process\" for three weeks when Bulbs.com states shipping information should be available in two business days.  Don't order from Bulbs.com unless you plan better than I do and order more than a month in advance."

"I was a first time customer of Bulbs.com and very pleased. I made a order and received it on time even with the holiday rush. Part of my order was missing and Kevin was quick to take my information and resolve it. I was a little concerned having never ordered from them that i might have just been out of luck. They were able to confirm a mistake was made and apologized and corrected it promptly. I rarely write a review good or bad, but I very rarely get customer service like this. The kind where I wished they offered other products  i use,  because I would definitely buy from them. Haven't even tried the products but I am not worried about it because I know if there is an issue it will be taken care of. Thanks Kevin."
"I got the wrong bulb on shipment, but I'm sure they will take care of me.  The person who answered my call was very experienced, and helped me out immensely in finding the correct specs for my event."

"Bulbs.com has good selection and free shipping.Order arrived in seven days.Bulbs were packed well and arrived intact."

"Tracking information never sent. Package delivered to wrong address in spite of correct one being entered. Took too long to ship even though expedited shipping was selected."
"FROM THE MOMENT I CALLED UNTIL I HUNG UP, I KNEW THIS WAS THE RIGHT PLACE TO HANDLE MY ORDER FOR  BULBS. I HAD INSTALLED COMMERCIAL LIGHTING 20 YEAR AGO AND THE BULBS WERE IMPROVED BY THE MANUFACTURER AS YEARS PASSED BY.  THIS YEAR 2020,  THE NUMBERS CHANGED ON THE PACKAGING AND I HAD NO IDEA IF THIS WAS WHAT I HAD ORGINALLY INSTALLED. I SEARCHED THE INTERNET AND AMAZON WAS FIRST TO POP UP. I DIDN'T KNOW ON THEIR WEB SITE IF THE BULBS I NEEDED WERE WHAT I WAS SEEING ON THE SCREEN AND I COULDN'T CALL THEIR RESELLERS AND IT WAS ALSO POSTED  NO RETURNS ON THE PURCHASE.  I SCROLLED A LITTLE FURTHER AND THE LIGHT IS NOW SHINING A LITTLE BIT BRIGHTER THANKS TO BULBS.COM.  THEY KNEW WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT AND I KNOW WHO TO TALK TO NEXT TIME I NEED BULBS."

"excellent people to work with. Fast delivery, Very happy dealing with Cole"
"I spoke with Jim Hindle about replacing my F96T12HO lights in my shop and my concerns for just how bright it would be in there if I replaced them with the LED bulbs. There was no pressure from him to buy. I went ahead and ordered the T896FR42/850/BYP2/RDC/LED bulbs. Though both the LED bulbs and the fluorescent bulbs were 5000k the LED bulbs were so much brighter and only use 42 watts vs the 110 watts for the HO fluorescent bulbs. With 20 bulbs being replaced I was using 18.33 amps and after the conversion I am now only using 7 amps. And if you can wire the ballast on the fluorescent fixture you'll easily be able to rewire the LED bulbs.I would highly recommend Bulb.com, Jim Hindle the these LED bulbs- you won't be disappointed."
"GREAT SERVICE PROPMT DELIVERY"
"Awesome company"
"Bulbs.com is a great resource for me. As a maintenance supervisor of an industrial manufacturing site, they always find what I need and get it to me quick! Jared Lockwood always goes above and beyond to take care of what I need. No matter how absurd the lighting application"

"Best place for ur lighting needs. Talk to Bill, he will take care of you"
"We recently ordered 5 - 46\" fluorescent tubes for our business. I was impressed with Bulbs.com's website. Easy to navigate and find what I wanted. The bulbs arrived in short order and were in perfect condition. I have ordered similar products and more often than not they come with breakage. These items were well packed and protected. A few weeks after we received the order we got a call from a company rep following up on the order to make sure that we were satisfied and to let us know that he was our dedicated account specialist. He advised me of special deals and invited me to call with any concerns or questions. This was done in a friendly but professional manner without taking up a lot of time. In today's world when you can usually not even speak to a human when you call a company, to deal with someone with such wonderful customer service skills is truly a pleasure. I recommend them highly and will be purchasing all of our lighting needs from them in the future. Thanks, Nick!"

"I have not received my order yet it’s July 3 rd and fed Ex are saying I will only receive on Monday . I asked them If I can come and pick up the item.They said no I can’t . The Fed Ex were very rude . I told them it’s emergency as it’s for a restaurant they said it’s not emergency as it’s just bulbs . I did it’s emergency for me as I have put those lights for out door sitting .They just hang up on me. Please look in to it. Why ?

"I want to compliment your sales team for the excellent customer service you have provided me recently. The first order was a bulb hard to find T-4 ultra slim 17 inch. I knew what i needed and was able to order it without assistance. I ordered one day and received it the next in this pademic state of our country, so I was in awe.A week later I decided i was not happy with the different color of lighting in my new home, so after hours searching your site, I still could not find what i wanted. So, i reached out to your sales team guy, Andy and this guy searched for 20 mins and let me email him my fixture. Finally, we found what i thought I could settle for. The order was placed on Apr 9th, a holiday weekend and i received the order the next day. I want to commend Andy and all responsible for making bulbs.com shine above ALL customer service that i have received in years. Keep up the good work and i will continue to praise and patronize your company."

"Excellent customer service."
"I had an issue ordering a discontinued product from another website.  After doing some research and realizing the product was not made anymore and extremely hard to come by, I stumbled upon Bulbs.com who seemed to have the product.  I reached out to them and got ahold of a gentleman named Duy Truong \"Dee.\"  I wanted to write a review giving him a shout out because he was a tremendous help.  Good help seems harder and harder to come by these days and he took the time to follow up with my questions.  So much so in fact, that he called their warehouse to confirm the product came with what was discontinued in the box and then followed up with me less then an hour later.  People like this, clearly take pride in what they do and appreciate their customers.  Highly recommend Bulbs.com.  Their customer service gave me no hesitation to purchase one of their products.  Dee, if you read this, thank you for following up with me and going above and beyond for an annoying customer.  Your professional attitude and quick response time along with follow up spoke volumes for you and your company.  Because, of todays experience, I will be saving Bulbs.com to my favorites list for future needs."
"Cheapest Price on the product that i needed online and in local stores"

"We ordered three outdoor led lights, which we had trouble with immediately upon installing.  Bulbs.com agreed to replace the first one, but then the second one immediately quit working.  It too was replaced.  Then, within a few months, all three of them quit working properly.  At this point, Bulbs.com quit responding to our complaints.  We also noticed that Bulb.com stopped selling the particular lights we had bought, so it's clear that others also had problems with them.  However, that's no excuse for Bulbs.com to claim no responsibility.  We will not be shopping here again."

I now have to pay electrician for another site visit to complete job once the rest of the bulbs arrive in next week or so. Communication is a good thing(!)."

"we are very much disappointed with the service we received by Mr. Ben potter. when we first talked about the led wall mount light we asked him specifically is it run by solar energy or by direct power supply lines, he told it runs on solar no power supply is needed just mount it on wall, we asked him because all the details can't be known looking at pictures it better to ask an expert. so we did ordered on base what he told but when it delivered we came to know it needs power supply line to get in turn on. Now we can't used it and decided to return it and we called Mr. Ben to ask for a return label he told we got to drop it off at FedEx and pay for the return this doesn't make sense why we pay for the return when we are not satisfied with product.we checked at FedEx for the cost it was like $75 and cost of lights is $96 that's wrong we got to pay more $75 and not even get the product back.we lost on both sides we can't even return it now and not satisfied with the service, not getting our money back that's not the way to do business this is very disappointing."

"To be honest, I am looking for a reason not to used Bulbs.com.  First of all, I love their lamp wizard - it makes selecting the lamp of your choice much much simpler.  I honestly don't know why more websites don't develop this.  Since LED lamps have so many choices, the wizard helps narrow it down.Second, the lighting specialist I used, Austin, has been fantastic.  He is knowledgeable and even knows the local energy supplier's rebate policies!  Bulbs.com is on the East Coast and I live on the West Coast - that's impressive.I'd encourage you to give Bulbs.com a try.  I think you'll like them!"
"Web site, selection and pricing are great.  Previous orders have been flawless.  This time someone should slap the flunkies in shipping with the poorly packed, beat up box that arrived with 5 of 8 bulbs broken.

With the delicate nature of the product there is, occasionally, some damaged product.  When this has occurred, Andrew and the people at Bulbs.com have provided exceptional customer service in getting us replacement and helping to ensure that orders are as protected as humanly possible to reduce damage during shipment.

I order bulbs in bulk and I have had a few bulbs that did not work, not sure what they are going to do in regards to that...the guy did suggest that I call immediately but really was unclear if they were going to credit my account send out a new bulb or what?  but  I guess I will see...I originally had been saving them as we came across them out of 24 we had approximately 6 that were bad.  I understand that in shipping probably things get shook around and perhaps that is how those get damaged but you are not going to know until you start replacing your bulbs \"as needed\".

"(12) Bulbs were delivered damaged in transit due to poor packing (no bubble wrap and the box was larger than necessary.  Contacted customer service to inquire about a return/replacement. Explained that the bulbs are rattling when shaken and they are not working in the light fixture.  The Bulbs.com agent told me that it's normal for the T5 bulbs to rattle and that my light fixture needs a new ballast!  I've contacted our building maintenance team lead and he indeed checked the ballast and looked at the bulbs...I'll be calling again today to ask again how to return them.Frustrated a bit."
"takes forever to receive any size shipment a little disturbing being that most distributors shipments within 3-5 days for most major orders, sooo when you guys say we have all you need in stock and will be dropped ship today why does it take so long? just wondering?? PS promotional codes should be automatically be awarded to commercial accounts when making a purchase to prevent our assigned code to be lost in transition by your sales people or assigned commercial agent. But you guys have the best stock and prices and knowledge professionals."

"Duy, one of the outstanding representatives for Bulbs.com, was a great help in making a difficult determination about what type of lighting and accessories I should use for my office.   He was clearly knowledgeable and informative, was humble enough to admit what he was not sure of, and caring enough to take the initiative to research the answers and then present me with the options along with the costs.  Moreover, his pricing was quite reasonable to start with even without the discount I requested and he graciously granted.   He was pleasant, answered my calls promptly, yet was not at all pushy.  I can't speak for all their representatives, though if the service I received from him is typical for their other representatives, I would recommend Bulbs.com highly and without reservation."
"Bulbs.com has been my go to bulb supplier for 7 years. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for good prices and those hard to find bulbs. I once needed a replacement bulb that I was unable to find on the website. I called the 800 number and sent a picture of the bulb to the representative. He found the bulb I needed and it was in stock. I received it the next day."
"I am with SP Plus,  I needed to order some light bulbs that I have ordered in the past directly from Bulbs.com.  However, they were not on the list.

"Bulbs.com has good pricing, fantastic customer service (have only dealt with one rep so far) but most importantly they ship bulbs in proper packaging. Too often vendors ship bulbs packed poorly with no fragile markings so when they arrive you have several that are broken and then you have to spend your time cleaning up the mess you received which includes cleaning up the broken glass as well as negotiating a credit or replacement bulbs. It was the quality of the packaging when I received my first order that I knew I'd be sticking with this vendor."

"There was a mixup with the rep and the wrong bulbs were sent, even though I put in writing what I needed.   I had to pay out of my pocket to ship them back, the rep did not offer any type of discount for my inconvenience.   I gave him the rep. a promo code twice, and even reminded him in an email that it wasnt sent....still never got it.  I spent around $900 on bulbs and never got any type of discount offered to me....until a few days after my order I got tons of promo codes and offers via email.  I feel ripped off."

"I look after the facilities of a large Catholic church and our lighting needs vary from building to building.  Bulbs.com has always provided us with the bulbs that fit our requirement and operate efficiently. Recently they enabled us to replace a fixture that was using 150 watts with one that draws 30 watts, putting out the same light and lasts many times longer. GREAT VALUE!  Bulbs.com is on my speed dial."
"Good fast service, unfortunately, one of four bulbs was broken upon arrival."
"Bulbs often come broken, and they are happy to replace those, but many times when a new bulb is installed a few months after you receive the order, those are broken too.  They just weren't visibly broken upon receipt. That's a little more difficult to explain to them. I feel like the money I save using Bulbs.com is often balanced out by having to throw several away without using them."
"Easy ordering and quick, on time shipment."
"Customer service was top notch. Love doing business with Bulbs.com"
"The website is very helpful in providing education about the many differences among lightbulbs.  The bulbs I ordered were arrived quickly and work well."

"Easy to use the website. Called and confirmed my findings and finished my translation on line. Great service"
"It was difficult finding the correct replacement bulbs, price was right for the bulbs needed, and they do carry a good assortment.    Shipping via FedEx Smartpost was not great.  It took 6 days (including extra day for MLK holiday) when it would have taken 3 days (2 days plus 1 for USPS to deliver) with UPS SurePost service.  I would have received my order 5 days sooner (because it would have been delivered before the weekend)."
"Site is simple, easy to use."

"The sales transaction was simple and without any issue- great turn around time too-"
"Thanks again"
"Needed 4 small light bulbs, unable to find on website due to information on bulb vs. system used by bulbs.com to identify.  Human helped me. Human was excellent.  Hope he was not paid on commission since the amount paid certainly would not have paid him, but, I suppose they make it up on big purchases.  Shipped promptly."
"Smooth, simple transaction, and the order was delivered promptly."
"All bulbs arrived intact and all work perfectly.  No hesitation to order from here again. :)"
"Never go wrong with bulbs.com!"
"I got my order much more quickly than I expected, it was complete and unbroken.  The bulbs were as advertised.  I would definitely use them again and recommend them."
"I had made an error on the shipping address in paypal when I made the order. I emailed the Bulb.com customer service rep right away. Early the next day I got an email letting me know the error had been fixed.  I was pleased they were able to help me fix a mistake I made."
"The bulbs are much warmer in color than the other 2700k bulbs I have. So much so, I have a hard time believing they are 2700k. They are closer to 2000. Also, it took over 2 weeks for my two bulbs to arrive. Makes me wonder how they can compete with Amazon Prime."
"fast, efficient & professional!"
"Don't like how you have to call to return things but at the same time it's very safe that way"
"Bulbs.com remembered to call me and check on my project, when I had forgot. The best thing about this site is they are NOT pushy with there sales and are very courteous. Thank you for helping me with my lighting issues. A+++++"
"Lauren is extremely helpful. I enjoy working with her."

"I am use to doing on line shopping and products get here a lot sooner than your company sends things, especially for the price of shipping."
"We have a cool old school fiber optic light here at our facility. It contained a special bulb inside. Bulbs.com not only had that bulb, but it was priced very well and arrived quickly! Prior to ordering I had a couple of questions. Their online chat was awesome! I had a couple of quick questions, and the chat made is quick and effective. Everyone should order from Bulbs.com!! :)"
"Great to do business with a supplier like Bulbs."
"Lousy service. Still haven't received the bulbs."
"I'll be back!"

"Thanks for making the order/delivery process easy and very efficient."
"I still haven't received my order. Almost 2 weeks seems excessive for two tiny fluorescent light starters."
"I cant review until my order has been received. It is still in transit.Your review is poorly timed."
"I send an order, you process it, and send the product. End of story. This time I was called and the phone call was disguised to seem like the rep was verifying the order I already placed. Immediately after verifying, before I could finish my sentence really, the rep blatantly starts soliciting me for private company information to do what I can only assume to be harass some one else at my company to get us to buy more from them. I was laughed at, mocked, and indirectly called a liar after I refused to provide more information several times over by what was a sales rep turned solicitor. I did not appreciate this. at all."

"I went to a well known hardware chain store to go buy some fluorescent light bulbs.  I took the old bulb with me so that there would be no issues.  I was greeted and found someone to help me and what do you know he hands me the bulb and I asked should the specs be the same.  He said  they are it's just a different wattage.  I said okay, so I return back to work to replace the light bulb in one of the light fixtures and it turned on for a moment and turned off.  I than tried it in another fixture and it did the same.  I return to my office and call the store and spoke with someone who was in the lighting dept. and they instructed me to bring the light fixture in because he thought it was the baluster.  I told him no I don't think that was the problem.  I decided to go on line and entered the specs and found the bulb.company.  I logged in and chatted with a customer representative and she was able to help me and even took the time to explain what the specs meant.  I placed an order and received them and wow they worked.  I spent two days and 2.5 hours dealing with the purchase/return.  In comparison the 20-minutes of research and 4-minute chat for the correct product.  I just assume that going to a local hardware store would have what I was looking for but that was not the case.  I am a very happy customer and have added them to our vendor contacts for future orders.Sincerely,Cynthia"

"In my neighborhood, we have nothing but problems with FedEx, so when given the option (which I was) at checkout, I will always opt for USPS, or UPS.  Upon checkout with Bulbs.com, I was given the choice between USPS, and FedEx. I chose USPS, and my order was shipped FedEx anyway.  Not a good first-time purchasing experience.  Pretty good last one, though."

He (and I truly regret that I can't recall his name) guided me thru everything and found the exact bulb I needed (out of the 10,000 out there!) just by the way I described it over the phone. I ordered a quantity of  90 and he understood I had a corporate budget to keep in line so he waived shipping charges.I didn't even ask for this! He also explained the meaning of all the codes on the bulbs so in the future I have better understanding of what I need. Then when I got my shipment, there was a gift in there for me! A very cool solar light! How thoughtful. Bulbs.com went above and beyond and exceeded my expectations. They have a customer for life and I will highly recommend to others.

"great price, efficient delivery - shipping costs a little high"
"things moved very fast and product came in great shape"
"This is the first time I have purchased from Bulbs.com. The prices were good. I only gave 4 stars because I think that when you purchase multiple bulbs the shipping price should go down. I don't like companies that have low prices and then get you with the shipping. I am not saying Bulbs.com does that but I still think shipping could have been cheaper. Shipping was very fast though."
"Online website order was very easy, and prices and warranty good compared with other vendors. Free and fast shipping completed the deal. Although we have yet to see if the bulb lasts as long as it is guaranteed, the shopping experience was perfect!"

"After searching home depot and other similar places I was about to give up on finding a bulb until I discovered this site.  The bulb came quickly and the site was easy to maneuver.  Shipping was a little steep which is the only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars."
"Everytime I have a question or place an order, I get an immediate response and often a phone call from a rep.  I now go straight to my representative and know I will have my order shipped either the same day, or if I call too late in the day, it will go out the next morning.  Can't say enough about their service.  I can even send them a picture of a bulb I need, and Jim will find it at a good price."

"Wide breadth of product, Competitive pricing"

"In a world of lightening fast shipping I was surprised when it took a week to get my order. Was beginning to think they lost my order. But no biggie, just nothing great either."
"You can't beat Bulbs.com for speed and quality of service!"
"I order frequently on various websites but this is out-dated and the worst I've seen in years! The problem is mainly in the checkout sequence.--The autofill function which most people use attempts to fill all spaces, but later you are required to go back and start over, but this time deleting duplicate and/or unneeded address information.--The progression from page to page is rather needless and time consuming. Why not do it all on one page? Why ask for duplicate information? --Why the nonsense of terms & conditions just to post a review??"
"I like Bulb.com because they offer all of the information about their product lines, and they offer free shipping - which is a big deal for fluorescent bulbs..  Their customer service is willing to work with you, and their website is easy to navigate."
"Good  customer service."
"Great resource."
"Fast delivery"
"Jared is the best!"
"consistent as always"
"With free shipping & a 10% off coupon, the order price beat all competitors, plus I didn't have to buy by the case.  The sales rep advised me of the best bulbs for our needs, placed the order & called 2 days after we received it before we could even erect the scaffolding to install the bulbs.  They even have a buy & try program so you can return bulbs if they're not exactly what you need.  Will be ordering from this company again."
"My sales rep Jim Fitzpatrick could not be better to work with. He always has time for my questions and finds the best answers for me. I have never felt that he is steering me wrong. The process of relamping a museum was made so much easier by Jim. I have told numerous people about Bulbs.com and how happy we are."
"Still waiting for bulb order"
"Could not be more pleased. Great response and service."
"They delivered like they said"
"Excellent service!  Would recommend Bulbs.com to anyone."
"Chris has been super helpful. thanks!"
"They have widest selection. In stock. Whenever I order I get next day."
"Bulbs.com always comes through when I am in need of an unusual bulb.  Even more so when I have the spent bulb in hand and don't have a clue what type of bulb it is - I love that Bulbs.com directs me to the bulb with pictures!  Sometimes I can find better prices on Amazon but Bulbs.com sales are unbeatable.  And the site is super user-friendly!!!"
"The items I purchased were almost a 3rd of the price in the Big Boy stores. In business, every penny counts and your site saved me quite a lot;."
"What more can I say?"
"We ordered 250 blue light bulbs to support our local police officers, Back the Blue campaign.  The lights are 60w and put out a very bright light and look fabulous when all houses on a street are blue!  Perfect!"
"Very easy to order!"
"Courteous well informed customer service was off the top!!"
"Excellent service, fast shipment."

I called another lighting company to find help on this particular bulb that I needed and I pretty much got laughed at. But Bulbs.com Found my bulb within a 3 minute telephone conversation! and had them shipped to me within 2 days time as I needed them promptly ! They will now be my go to for bulbs ! Bulbs.com !"

Bill McNally and Katelyn Milliken have been the two specialists I have had the opportunity to work with and they both have been exceptional.  I have even sent pictures of bulbs that I needed when there were no descriptive markings and they have been able to source what we needed very quickly.  Bulbs.com literally brightens our days!"

"The price of the blub was far less than the OEM price and two day shipping was delivered early on the second day. The bulb DT00871 was for a Christie LW400 Projector.  That's the good news. The friction was with the install. The power pins on the blub would not lineup with the projector. Had to disconnect the power pins from its housing (fortunately it was screwed in to its housing and had a short wire to manipulate) and manually plug it in then fiddle with the bulb to make it fit into the projector.  Once it lined up and was screwed down it worked but I hate to think I will have to go thru that again with the next replacement bulb.  This bulb was the only one listed as compatible with the projector."
"The ordering process with bulbs.com was super fast and extremely easy. Not only did the items arrive within the next 2 days,  but they also aided me in find replacements for items that did not work with my fixtures. They really care about the consumers over at bulbs.com."
"I enjoyed working with them."
"Received this order quickly, as ordered, packed well, all items in working order and as advertised."
"Great job !! Great job!!!"
"I like bulbs.com, but the bulbs are a bit pricey. It went up from the last time I bought halogen bulbs, but they are one of the only places that sells them online. It was shipped to me in a reasonable time period and I had no problems finding what I needed. Overall, good experience."
"I'd be happy to leave an honest and favorable review in exchange for good service.  And I'm still optimistic.  But I ordered bulbs for an X-ray view box awhile ago and have yet to receive them.  The fact that I'm being asked for a review tells me that the delivery was somehow delayed.  Here's hoping I'll ultimately have a different experience."
"Bulbs .com  was just recently found by us. They have provided us with harder to find items with excellent pricing. We will be back.Many Thanks, Will"
"Excellent price and received our bulbs quickly and in excellent condition"
"John called to make sure I received my shipment and was great to work with when trialing bulbs"
"Great prices, fast shipping and excelent customer service!"
"we're a small family restaurant with 12 ceiling fans, and we needed to replace ALL the bulbs with something that is both sturdy and nice looking at a decent price. we also had restrictions on what our dimmer would handle. the bulbs.com site was easy to use and we found great bulbs matching our needs at about 50 cents each. If I had one complaint it's that the shipping should be free for any order over a certain number of bulbs, not over a certain dollar amount (we ordered over 59 to get a lower per-bulb price so we thought that should include free shipping). but overall we're thrilled and will order from them again."
"Price is competitive, and I can always get someone on the phone which is not always the case these days with most internet re-sellers."
"I place order on Thur or Fri and received on Monday. 8' bulbs and not one damaged. I do think the ends could have been more secure."

"Great service and fast shipping and when Your in the dark fast is most important."
"Bulbs.com is one of the best I have found, but sometimes they are beaten on price and availability by Amazon. I think they could do more with the website in linking older style bulbs CFL's and Tungsten with their LED retrofit replacement options. I would like to see a link on the website page for say a CFL bulb which will take me to the LED alternatives to that bulb. This would be a very useful feature. Cheers"
"Having searched for a particular bulb at length and finding the majority of retailers would not bother to stock it or had a ridiculously high price on them, I finally ran across BUlbs.com. Since then they have all my business in this field. Great business."

"Our main sources of living room lighting are two antique floor lamps with mogul bases.  We ran out of our reserve of mogul bulbs as they are difficult to locate nowadays.  i was pleased to find Bulbs.com and the 100-200-300 w mogul bulbs were delivered to us very quickly.  We have not yet tried them out; however, I have every reason to believe that they are perfectly workable.  Bulbs.com is a great company with a very needed and wanted product."
"This item was truly quality replacement as advertised, not a cheap knock-off, which are so tempting but we have experienced on multiple occasions is not worth it.  And shipped quickly."
"Delivery was on time and in great shape."

"Ridiculous fast shipping...would have given 5 stars but a coupon was enclosed for 10 percent on next purchase. Went to use it on my next 600.00 dollar purchase but was not applicable...I am sick of disclaimers and  items not included. My items were not sale items."

"I had a singel bulb in my store's fixture that I could not figure out what it was. I was on the phone I think with Jared and he had me take some photos of the bulb and the fixture. I sent to him via email and he guessed as to what it was. He then sent me a single bulb for $1.99 and no charge for shipping. That was a lot of time for just one bulb. It worked, I will always do business with this company. Its not the first time they have displayed caring customer service.Thank you,Janice  GainesSpa Manzanita"
"We had a hard time finding the right bulb for a certain type of fixture with a protective shield,a regular bulb just wouldn't reach. Thankfully Bulbs.com had the right choice in stock and had them to us the next business day.Thanks Bulbs.com ."

"Every time I buy a new appliance or high end light fixture, it seems the light bulbs they require are more obscure than the country where they are made. By the time I need a new bulb for said appliance, the owners manual with replacement parts listings is long lost. Walking into the big box home store with the dead bulb is useless. I now just go straight to bulbs.com where I always find what I am looking for and I always find it priced well."
"Had a problem with damaged bulbs.  Contacted Bulbs.com and they were quick to send replacement the next day.  Great customer service!!"

Home Depot often did not have cases of the size I needed so I was unable to get any kind of price break.  Bulbs.com had the exact style of bulb I needed and at a much less expensive price.  I even received an additional discount on my first order.  In addition I got free shipping when I bought in quantity.  Although it will take a while to use the quantity I purchased it was well worth it.  The delivery time was also very fast.  From now on I will look to Bulbs.com for all the bulbs I need I larger quantities."

"Service is key.  Bulbs.com, their representative and my sales rep has always provided me excellent service for all my lighting needs and requirements for our facilities.  I would have awarded 5 stars, however I find that I can almost always find product elsewhere at a better price.  But as I stated, service can be more important than price and coming from a company where our customer service is exemplary, we expect the same from others whom we do business."

"crisp clean makes my new paint look 100 times better than old bulbs"
"I ordered 8 cases of T8 fluorescent lamps, (4 cases u-bent and 4 cases 4') on the 22nd of Dec. and received them Christmas eve. Bulbs.com were faster than my local supplier."
"I ordered [2] bulbs (granted, they are fragile - but with a site named \"bulbs.com\" you would think this is a known issue and they would be better prepared for this) - and granted these were long and skinny (48\" T8 LED 'Drop In' replacements) - on the 1st shipment both bulbs arrived broken. It only took a little over a week (8 Calendar Days, even with having to await a 2nd shipment) so I was sitting in the dark for a lot longer than I would have been had I gone local. Of course, the selection would be smaller and the price higher as well - all of which factor into my opinion. They WERE DELIVERED INITIALLY VERY QUICKLY @ 2 DAYS from order date - so that is/was a huge plus. And when I called about the problem, the rep was very courteous and understanding - he immediately got another order on the way (though he seemed to be insinuating that the root cause might be that I ordered the \"glass\" version of this product when they offer a \"plastic\" version) - but again, bulbs.com sells glass bulbs and in my opinion should be prepared to have the items they sell delivered undamaged either through better packaging or through a better carrier relationship - perhaps an understanding with the carrier that all of their packages are very fragile and should be treated with more care. I don't know the answer, but I am not in the business of selling glass items to be shipped daily so I don't have to know. I do, however, know that I was in the dark for a week after ordering the items before a usable item arrived.I can't really bash them terribly over that miscue - fast delivery, great prices and excellent / courteous Customer Service. And the broken items were not directly their fault - the packaging was decent...just not enough for that particular trip.I try to grade things from this perspective - It's not whether or not there are problems (there WILL be from time to time in any business), it's how the Company responds to and deals with problems when they do occur. And from that perspective - they rate 5 Stars. The only thing keeping me from putting a 5 Star rating overall is just the nature of this particular beast....and the fact that the 1st shipment should have been packaged like the 2nd. Something in my gut tells me that they might go quick and easy on the first shot - and if they see a \"free/replacement\" order come thru, then they go extra careful with it - because there was DEFINITELY a huge difference in the way the 2nd order was packaged.As for the lights themselves - GREAT quality, GREAT light output (I ordered the Phillips InstantFit T8 LED Drop-In Replacement - 2450 Lumens @ only 17 Watts) = GREAT VALUE. I WILL be ordering more."
"Will buy from again"
"We have been dealing with Bulbs.com for about 4 years now.  Each experience has been excellent.  No problems, they stay in touch and generally provide a good product at a fair price."
"I didn't receive yet the order even after  a week. I tracked the order and it is still in local Fedex truck for the fourth day straight."
"Quick Easy Painless To the point"
"Bulbs.com was very  thorough  when making my selection for my project to make sure I was  purchasing the I needed.  The customer service did not stop after I hung up,  received emails confirming my order.   They also  email and called me to confirm that I received my bulbs.  Good job👍🏼"
"The bulbs were delivered quickly."
"easy to navigate site to find what I wanted..shipment arrived quickly."
"Would have rated 5 stars but so far have not been able to check how well they do at resolving issues since I have not had any in seven months of doing business with them. Prices are very good as well..."

"Found the items I needed ordered them and received them in a timely fashion. Yes I would recommend Bulbs.com to a friend."
"Vendor has fairly easy website to navigate.  I'm very sensitive about seeing clutter whether in real life or on a web page.  It bothers me.  Bulbs.com site is a little bit cluttered but not nearly as bad other sites.  I can find what I'm looking for pretty easy and the prices have been consistently competitive.  Also bulbs, being fragile by design, need to be well protected during shipments.  Their packaging has been very good.  Never received a broken bulb and the one defective bulb I every received was immediately replaced at n/c. They have been a good source for my electrical business.    I have referred other folks to them."
"I went through the \"bulbfinder\" process and selected what I thought were the right bulbs.  Within 10 minutes after placing the order, I realized I had ordered 48 inch bulbs, when I needed 96 inch bulbs.  There is no way to cancel the order from the web site that I could see, so I sent an email right then to advise that I didn't want the 48 inch bulbs.  The next morning I received an email saying that it was too late and the orders placed over the weekend had been filled and would be shipped.  I called customer service when the bulbs were delivered and explained the situation.  They agreed to refund me for the bulbs and would waive the 20% restocking fee, but I would have to pay to ship them back.  I don't agree that I should have to pay the shipping."
"Hadn't ordered in a few years, called to help duplicate the old order and within a few minutes Greg found it and I re-ordered.  Would not hesitate to order from them again.  Oh did I mention the free shipping !!!"
"Received unbroken and quickly. No problems"
"Got exactly what I needed in a timely fashion for a reasonable price."

"Staff is very friendly and helpful. Good prices fast shipping"
"I ordered the bulbs I needed and They sent me just that, at a good price!"
"We have had a good experience with Bulbs.com. For the most part, the bulbs last a proper length of time, but sometimes they burn out quicker than at other times. Recently we were give an online coupon as we entered the website, but when it came time to add the discount code to our order, it said that the discount code was not recognized, so the discount was negated and we were charged full price."
"Very satisfied with the product quality and price. Very happy I found bulbs.com. Their customer department is warm and professional and very helpful.Thank you so much."
"Bulbs.com was really helpful.  I was having trouble figuring out which lightbulb would fit my chandelier, and they knew exactly the right one, which arrived the next morning. I will definitely order from them again."
"Great selection, standard shipping was free and surprisingly speedy.  The cost per bulb was actually lower than the brick and mortar bulb retailer I tried (as well as a number of online retailers').Other retailers' prices and shipping are higher and shipping is always  slower. I buy the bulbs for the office and it is my job to find the quickest/most cost effective retailer."

"Every step along the way went very smoothly. Product arrived in good condition in a timely fashion."
"John was very helpful and provide me with information that I need very quickly and has been very pleasant in the same time."
"The product offering is fabulous--every imaginable bulb, and all instock.  Once ordered, the bulbs are delivered the very next day.Just a supurb company to do business with."
"Excellent service with the right bulbs and fast delivery"
"I keep ordering my bulbs from them because I just do not want to drive to the box store to purchase them.  I also \"think\" that their supplier makes a better bulb.  They just seem to last longer than they ones I was purchasing from the local hardware store.  I tend to purchase large quantities because some bulbs are discontinued and I want a stockpile.  Kicking the can down the road I guess.  My last order could last me 3 years...yea!"
"Great Service Received my Package next day"
"First time using the company.For the bulbs i needed this was the most convenient way to purchase.Delivery was prompt and on time.lets see how the bulbs perform"

"Because we had done business with bulbs.com in the past, they contacted us just to see if we needed to restock. Once we got into conversation, we found that one of our bulbs had been discontinued and Marissa helped walk me through which bulb would be the best replacement. She was super helpful, super polite, and super efficient. Anyone who gets set up with her is a lucky customer."
"LED bulbs described as \"dimmer compatible\" did not function, as they were only compatible with certain dimmers, not mine. Product descriptions should be more detailed."
"Customer service representative was great with order. Package arrived in order and without delay. Tracking information was given via email. Will definitely use Company in the future and refer to others."
"I don't know why we didn't think of bulbs.com, but glad we found the website. Our preschool will definitely use from now on.  Very nice and helpful people at customer service because I ordered the wrong bulbs at first.  Thank you, Palma Ceia Pres. Preschool"

Still waiting for my order."

"FedEx Ground11900 Trolley LaneBeltsville, Maryland20705	Dear Manager,	I am attaching the travel history for a package your man delivered at 4:59 p.m. today.  Please note that he indicated yesterday that the “customer was unavailable or business closed” at 4:46 p.m. (copy attached).  I told him today that I had waited for him both yesterday and Monday until 6:00 p.m. and that he had posted the business closed note for Wednesday.  He denied that he had marked it such, and I angrily told him not to lie to me.  He insisted he was correct.	I have had this difficulty with this driver for over six years.  For the last two years he has been better, but he has now burned the bridge."
"I'm very very very satisfied with your products and service yes I am going to purchase again from you I'm so glad I found you you brighten my life literally thanks very much"

"I am the operations manager of a 240,000 sq ft facility and have always tried to purchase locally but when financial times struck I started searching more online to save cost and have purchased from several name brand locations and some not so much but every time bulbs.com has been real close to one of the least expensive places to get most of my lighting items. But over time I’ve become to trust my Commercial Lighting Specialist, Greg Hikel, like he was a local supply house. He keeps in contact with me and any time I have a special need he does what he can to help me find what I need and helps keep our cost down and is honest when he can’t. Besides that, I can tell you the shipping department has never let me down like some other places, never had to wait weeks on a shipment and have never received a damaged bulb even if it was shipped with a heavy ballast. So my recommendations on bulbs.com is very high, should it be one bulb or ballast or a couple of 100 they have yet to let me down."
"We needed a  bulb that fits a sanitizer. When we called the company that  we purchased the equipment from they were rude and not helpful at all. they said it may be weeks before they could get a replacement bulb and refused to give us a number or item number to find it someplace else. We called your company and with just a description and not anythings else they had replacement bulbs to us in 5 days.  Thank you!"
"Easy to order. Quick & efficient delivery!"
"Very good customer service experience"
"Time to change to LED bulbs.  They save money and last a l o n g time.Great to cut down on power usage in our RV."
"Easy ordering, good discount deals, and very fast shipping. Use site often and never disappointed."
"The company could not be more helpful and pleasant to do business with. In today's market it was a pleasant surprise. Keep up great work."
"I called for advice on what type of bulb I needed for my work stations. Jennifer helped me with literally unbelievable knowledge and great communication skills. She suggested a type of bulb, which I ordered and when they arrived safely and quickly they were perfect for my needs. I ordered more later that day. I've found a new supplier for my companies bulbs."
"Was able to locate the product that I needed quickly, good value, and the website was very user friendly.  Ordered late on a Thursday and my items were delivered Tuesday of the following week.  Very hassle free transaction."
"The representative from Bulbs.com (Mark W.) was absolutely terrific,help us with ordering the correct bulbs, and the price was more than reasonable. Delivery time was amazing, what a surprise! Thank you so much, we will order from you again! Cheers!"

"Quick shipEasy to use website Fair competitive pricing"
"Ordering both online and over the phone is very easy.  Rep was amazing, contacted us both by phone and email to let us know how we could save money on our order.  Even made the pricing retroactive for a prior order over six months ago."
"I was able to find a specialty bulb for a commercial refrigerator, but paid $9.85 for shipping the single bulb"
"Was such a nice surprise to get a great closeout price on four dozen CFL's. I love to find deals.Bulbs.com seems to have a nice selection to choose from at good prices, but I have a couple of wishes. There are a number of brands that I have no experience with, and this site gives no clue as to the quality rating for each other than do I just assume \"the higher the price, the higher the quality\"? You don't have to become Amazon Ratings, but some hints might help.And drilling down to find the type and rating can be cumbersome. I wish the selection process was easier and faster rather than having to view page after page sometimes."
"My customer service rep. was great. She knew what I wanted and was very well versed in her product. I got a chance to test multiple bulbs before choosing the right one. The service was phenomenal .I got my bulbs the next day with free shipping.I would highly recommend Bulbs.com to all I know.Thank you"
"They always have the bulbs in stock that we use, a Par 38 Blue.  The free shipping they offer at times is a great benefit."
"No delays good prices."
"I have used bulbs.com for several years.  I found their bulbtrack indispensable since I buy some weird bulbs.  Finding an odd bulb can be some work, but don't give up.  I converted an outdoor light fixture from 12V to 120V (it was rated for 250V, but they used a transformer to make 12V, 50W).  So I removed the transformer, and needed a 120V bulb of the desired style that plugged into the old socket (pin spacing).  Not your hardware store item!"
"Great bulbs, great quality at a great price."
"Sent pictures of the bulbs I needed, they researched them andfound me perfect matches. Great service."

"Exactly what I needed at a great price and fast delivery!"
"Jen helped me find the right flood lights for our living room ceiling.  They even mailed me 2 different LED floods and I returned postage free the one we did not use. We settled on an LED bulb that lasts for 22 years rather than 2 years.  Not only this, each bulb costs $22 but saves us $8 per year in electricity usage over the alternative bulbs. Over 22 years, that $22 bulb will save us $176 in electricity usage.   How great is that??"
"As always with dealing with Bulbs.com, I have nothing but good to say.  Very professional.  Take time to work with me to choose the best product.  Good pricing!  I highly recommend them!"
"The company answered my questions promptly. Quickly sent out my order of exactly what I ordered online. Thanks guys."
"I love the fact that I can specify 130 volt bulbs for our historic church and my personal home and grounds. Nothing compares to the simplicity and quality of light from an incandescent bulb. The 130 volt version of Bulbs.com's 8, 25, 40, 60 and 100 watt outputs is especially warm and rich in color. Most interiors and indeed, most people, look much better with more points of light at lower wattages. The higher voltage rating Increases the life substantially.  While hardware stores tell you \"Sorry, phasing out the incandescents.. How about these NEW bulbs with their weird, icy,  grayish-blue light so you feel like you're being sterilized by a germicidal lamp? AND you get them for the bargain price of 12 times the cost of the bulb you actually want! How many of these miserable psychosis-inducing bulbs would you like?\"  to which I'll reply, \"None! I'll be special-ordering REAL bulbs with REAL light, at GREAT prices from BULBS.COM! Hundreds and hundreds of them!\"   And so it goes, one more hoarder of normalcy giving a glowing review of Bulbs.com for making life good. Stock up now!"
"You would think that light bulb shopping is just a commodity, but it's not. I've tried to get bulbs on Amazon, and it's an inferior experience to bulbs.com, because bulbs.com has optimized their shopping interface for exactly what their product is. I'm a fan."
"Easy to order, they checked to make sure I received my order and it was right.  Order was hear fast."
"Received yesterday and installed today.  All 4 only partially light.  Think it's a ballast problem as opposed to the bulbs."
"Fast & accurate."
"I received the bulbs I ordered and it turned out to be the wrong ones. Their customer service was great and helped solve my problem. I would shop with them again"
"I ordered dozens of bulbs and I received a few that were damaged. They sent replacements promptly without any hassle."
"I found the bulbs I needed easily and quickly, my order was processed and shipped quickly and accurately. Good site to order from!"
"Great place with a vatiety of bulbs to choose from & a short wait time for delivery."
"Great customer service and prompt shipping!"
"Purchased an Odd sized T4 9 3/4\" bulb for a sign.  Correct size fit perfectly after searching and purchasing wrong size from another company.  Super fast service."

"I will keep ordering in this website, they are professional, the bulb finder tool is awesome."
"Quick response to price quote request for multiple LCD projector bulbs.Processing of my order was handled same day, with the bulbs shipping immediately from stock."
"Without hesitation, I would recommend anyone to make their bulb purchases through bulbs.com."
"Good place to find bulbs that are hard to find elsewhere, but it pays to compare prices on standard bulbs unless you're bulk ordering. Customer service unresponsive to website problems such as logins etc."
"Got what we wanted with great prices, n free shipping, and quick too."
"Mark Wrona at Bulbs.com always goes above and beyond to get us the items we need.  Always quick to respond and when he's out of the office his colleagues take over and provide the same excellent customer service."
"I'm happy I found what I wanted at Bulbs.com and the prices are good.  I am disappointed that it took longer than was told. I ordered on a Friday and was told it would arrive a week from the next Monday.  It did not arrive until the following Thursday which meant it took almost two weeks. I called several times to find out what happened. The first time, I was told it would arrive Tuesday, instead of Monday. Then on Tuesday, it did not arrive so I called and was told that they use Fed-Ex and the post office and it was because of the post office it was taking so long. They said it would arrive Wednesday. I called again Wednesday and they said most likely Thursday it would arrive. The post office is 3 blocks from my house. Because of this experience, if I am going to order something from Bulbs.com, I will now expect the order to take up to two weeks for the items to arrive."
"Great choice of bulbs"
"Excellent service from David.  He went far \"beyond the call\" to meet my unique needs."
"I recently received an order that I purchased and one of the bulbs didn't work.  I called up customer services and received a new bulb within 2 days, with no hassle, I might add."

"seemless, fast"
"I value customer service over good prices and large selections.  Sam Houston (along with others) have demonstrated outstanding customer service.  That fact has created a loyalty with our business.  I only buy elsewhere when Bulbs.com doens't have what we need.  Thank you for demonstrating that people matter!"
"For the second shipment in the row, broken bulbs."
"Bulbs.com is easy to do business with.  They have fair prices and stand behind their products even when it's not their fault.  A few years ago I had a shipment with numerous broken bulbs......they replaced them with no questions asked."
"This was our first time purchasing from Bulbs.com. The customer service experience was excellent! We needed some specialty bulbs by a certain date. Our account rep not only made sure that the order was sent out priority, she also followed up to make sure that we received the bulbs on time. When FedEx missed the delivery she called to expedite it and get the package to us in time for our event."
"Not only did they save me more than 70% off of the prices I was quoted at a local store, they were very knowledgeable and the shipping was fast. I would definitely use them again!"

"Received my order with the correct merchandise on the day I was told"

"For international orders Brian, is the man to deal with, very professional at Service and getting stuff to you on time. Thanks a lot Brian.From Turks and Caicos Islands."
"My order was handled quickly and efficiently."
"critical part regarding our selection of LED bulb is that they are rated for \"fully enclosed fixture\".   some product did not match what it said on the website to what it said on the product packageI think it is important that same set of information is stated on the product description, which amazon fails to do when it comes to the light bulbs.  However, some of the information set changes, and should be updated."
"Easy site to use and purchase from"
"Found Bulbs.com while doing a general internet search.  Called the company due to some questions.  John in the sales department was very helpful.  I needed two ballasts that they did not stock but John found them for a very competitive price, added the bulbs I needed and made a complete order.  I received the materials in a very short period of time.Their commitment to customer satisfaction is at a level I have not experienced in a while!"

"Bulbs.com had the unique bulbs that I was looking for and at a great price. The bulbs were expertly packaged and arrived very quickly. I would definitely reorder from them. FYI - Their prices were better than I was finding on Amazon. Cheers....."
