"Order placed easy. Delivery was fast and in good condition. I made the mistake of ordering the wrong bulb. I was very disappointed that I couldn't return the item for exchange without paying a large amount of money. That's something I think may be helpful to change. But I was truly glad to find what I needed at your company"
"Alexis was extremely helpful and professional. She took her time to listen to my needs and sent price quotes promptly. Also. I needed help with tax exemption of which she was able to help. I received my globes in a very timely manner!!"
"Easy to find various options searching site for LED replacements for dual mini-flourescents with full specs listed, including base type, color (warmth), brightness (lumens), and interface (direct A/C and w/ballast and compatible with both).  Good price, and quick delivery.  Got exactly want I expected, site made it easy to reach and compare, and the LED replacement bulbs fit & works perfectly."
"Shipped in time but unfortunately my bulbs was damaged during transport but Kristin and Pam reacted super fast on my claim and send replacements! "
"For difficult to find bulbs especially LED replacements, 1000bulbs is the best. Their online interface is easy to use and fast. Shipping is expensive but fair and quick. All around good experience."
"As a contractor, I can say this is not the best place to go. I've done some level of business with 1000bulbs.com for years now. Our last project that we used 100 bulbs as a vendor will be our last purchase. Fixtures and lamps from same manufacturer at same color were not the same color lamps. We tried different products from 1000bulbs but were not able to get a color match. Had to go to one of our regular wholesalers before we could get the situation resolved. Lots of wasted time, jobsite labor and money with minimal help or real concern from the 1000bulb staff."
"Great prices, expansive selection, excellent service, and packing/delivery is exceptional!  Been using 1000Bulbs for years!"
"Outstanding Custer service.  It’s always a pleasure doing business with a team of experts.  When you get a great company like this and the “same” advisor that knows you by name, you have a known quantity that understands you and your needs!  Great customer service and Connor is out representing the company and its values.  Bob Effler"
"I have ordered from 1000Bulbs.com before and that is why I returned for a new set of specialty bulbs for some new fixtures I installed in my kitchen. The bulbs arrived very well packaged and all were functional."
"The salesman, Chad Pederson, the quality and ease of installment."
"Good price, product was exactly what I needed. Hard to find 5000k bulbs some times. Wish there were less expensive shipping option."
"I had a concern and they were immediately on top of it.It ended up being very minor (thank goodness). But they rectified it even though I told them it was not necessary. I will continue to use them for our light bulb needs."
"I bought their recommended 8' LED florescent replacement lamps for a commercial coffee roaster customer. These are for the ceiling fixtures in their warehouse.Using the lamp manufacturer's life rating, in this application (on 10 hours a day) they should have lasted 20 years. The first one failed after 3 months, now 2 more... so one by one they are failing and rather then sending out a better quality replacement at their cost, they are issuing pro-rated credits (sigh).To me this means they do not test the lamps or source high quality products, so beware that failure might be a common experience. Also, prorating the credits is sleezy and means they do not stand behind the items they recommend.Will I buy from them again? Nope!"
"I was struggling to find purple candlestick bulbs that actually glowed purple. I ordered and returned other brands several times because they looked pink or red when plugged in. The online rep shared a link to the comments about these lights (positive reviews for purple color) so I gave them a shot. I was not disappointed! They glow a nice true purple. Thanks for the help!"
"They helped me find exactly what I needed and had been looking in dozens of stores for. Best part is it all worked exactly as offered. "
"Easy ordering good product, price and delivery."
"Extremely happy with their customer service and their pricing.Have an account with them that was set up by a different person that is no longer with my organization (didn't know the sign in username or password). I spoke with the Commercial Account Manager and he changed the login information for me and took my order. After I gave him my order, he asked if there was anything else I needed or wanted. After I told him no, he explained to me their minimum order amount and free shipping. I ended up with an extra light fixture and a case of LED bulbs for less than my original order amount."
"Products arrived as commited, were well-packed and met expectations."
"The delivery was great, ordered it on Wednesday and got it on Saturday, over Thanksgiving, could not believe it. The quality of the products are excellent. Just finished installing all the lights and everything worked out perfectly. If and when I need more lighting equipment I will definitely purchase it from this company. Thanks"
"Customer service was helpful prior to ordering the LED Customer service was helpful prior to ordering the LED Christmas lights (pure white).  Order came quickly and the lights are perfect.  First, they do not flicker, just as the phone rep had assured me. Second, they are very bright, so much so that I bought a dimmer and the lights work perfectly with dimmer.  Only negative is price, but these kind of flicker-free LED light are expensive everywhere."

"I found regular A19 incandescent bulbs at 1000bulbs.com. My intention was to buy 3 dozen bulbs. The product says \"$3.84 each.\" And just to the left in the description, it says \"12 per case.\" So I started the order. When they wanted to charge me over $14 for shipping I decided it was worth it to pay this shipping rate for 36 bulbs since the product price was so good. $28 total. HOWEVER, I received 3 bulbs in an 8x8x8 box with foam peanuts. When I called to explain and complain, they said it's made clear further down in the description. I asked for a return shipping label to return the product. They said OK. The next day I receive an email with a return address and an explanation they don't pay for return shipping and that it might not be worth returning the bulbs. Wow! I emailed back to explain that they were using deceptive marketing practices and to please pay for return shipping and refund the returned product. No communication after that. I'm guessing they know people will get confused and depend on them not wanting to pay for return shipping. What a racket!  UPDATE: Once they saw my complaint, 1000bulbs immediately sent me a refund for the product, but not the shipping (which cost more than the product). They didn't respond to a request for shipping reimbursement."
"Ordered 3 light bulbs which were delivered within a few days. When I thought it was really great was that these bulbs were packed very securely a box that was a decent size and packed very carefully with Styrofoam peanuts. The box was secure, and I was very happy that they took extra care in packaging the lightbulbs to prevent breakage. I will order again from them because I feel very confident in their product and they’re shipping"
"Before contacting 1000 Bulbs, I had tried multiple other sites and an unsuccessful trip to a big box store to find LED replacement bulbs that fit our fixture. The chat operator responded immediately to my inquiry and located two options. The order arrived very quickly and the bulbs were exactly what I needed."
"The person who answered the phone was absolutelygreat because she was patient, smart, and when she could not find an item I requested she found another source for me to go to.That's Awesome!Thank you 1000bulbs!James Truesdale"
"Crystal at 1000Bulbs communicated clearly and promptly with me so I knew what was happening with my special order, when to expect it, and also answered the phone within 2 rings-so nice not to get an automated answering machine with many questions!  I actually received my order more quickly than expected.  Definitely I will call them if I have any more electrical needs!  Very nice company!"
"1000Bulbs had the exact replacement sockets I needed to rebuild a heat lamp for my restaurant. Easy ordering, fast shipping.."
"You are an extremely efficient and superior company to do business with, from start to finish. Placing the Oder is easy, no hassle. Shipping is quick. And your packaging to keep the bulbs safe from damage is impeccable!  I have ordered from you before and was super pleased. That’s why I came back!!"
"1000Bulbs kicks ass! I got 25% off, received my order in 3 business days, and when I called for advice spoke to customer service immediately and had all my questions answered. I bought a socket spool and C7 lights for my house and it looks amazing."
"The best customer service - multiple names and numbers provided.Received order in less than four days.All bulbs lite up.Two hundred bulbs installed in less than five hours.Order Confirmation form is the best layout I have seen."
"Michael Said is a super technical adviser who helps our church on light bulbs selection. It is rare to have such a nice, knowledgeable person to help us when we need it."
"I've ordered from 1000 bulbs a few times before and always got what I wanted.  I'm reviewing them today after they DIDN'T have what I wanted.  I needed a specific kind of mini candelabra base with a \"cool\" (whiter) light.  A rep tried to find what I needed.  They didn't have it, but they referred me to a specific competitor who did have it.  THAT is customer service!"
"These guys always have the best prices on their lighting and are always helpful with our needs. They ship really quick, too.  The lights got here on Monday and were just ordered the Thursday before.  Thank you."
"Alexis Dominguez Was more than helpful. She had no issues dealing with the many changes we had and was always pleasant. Very knowledgeable and quick to respond!"
"I’ve had a difficult time finding clear bulbs for my bathroom heat lamp. They had exactly what I needed!  My order shipped quickly and was carefully packed to ensure the fragile bulbs arrived safely."
"My first time making a purchase with this company. Jordyn in customer service was very helpful with my order."
"I just received the sockets moments ago... They are of excellent quality. I would only suggest that you find a lower shipping cost. The items were overly packaged, and could easily have fit in a padded envelope."
"Finally the Christmas lights my wife has always wantedMy wife and I have been wanting to have a nice set of warm white lights lining the edge of our roof for years, I even built the house with outlets positioned to make it as clean and easy as possible, but I could never find a good dealer for high quality commercial grade cords and lights that I could customize to exact lengths, but now I have and we couldn’t be happier!!"
"The bulbs arrived in 2 days, they work beautifully, & you packed the shipment so carefully, your price was the best I've found; I bought the color changing led c9 bulbs"
"I've always had good experiences shopping here.  The prices are great and the selection is even better.  The filter tools are also well thought out to get you exactly what you're looking for."

But I was truly glad to find what I needed at your company"

"For difficult to find bulbs especially LED replacements, 1000bulbs is the best. Their online interface is easy to use and fast. Shipping is expensive but fair and quick. All around good experience."
"As a contractor, I can say this is not the best place to go. I've done some level of business with 1000bulbs.com for years now. Our last project that we used 100 bulbs as a vendor will be our last purchase. Fixtures and lamps from same manufacturer at same color were not the same color lamps. We tried different products from 1000bulbs but were not able to get a color match. Had to go to one of our regular wholesalers before we could get the situation resolved. Lots of wasted time, jobsite labor and money with minimal help or real concern from the 1000bulb staff."
"Great prices, expansive selection, excellent service, and packing/delivery is exceptional!  Been using 1000Bulbs for years!"
"Outstanding Custer service.  It’s always a pleasure doing business with a team of experts.  When you get a great company like this and the “same” advisor that knows you by name, you have a known quantity that understands you and your needs!  Great customer service and Connor is out representing the company and its values.  Bob Effler"
"I have ordered from 1000Bulbs.com before and that is why I returned for a new set of specialty bulbs for some new fixtures I installed in my kitchen. The bulbs arrived very well packaged and all were functional."
"The salesman, Chad Pederson, the quality and ease of installment."
"Good price, product was exactly what I needed. Hard to find 5000k bulbs some times. Wish there were less expensive shipping option."
"I had a concern and they were immediately on top of it.It ended up being very minor (thank goodness). But they rectified it even though I told them it was not necessary. I will continue to use them for our light bulb needs."
"I bought their recommended 8' LED florescent replacement lamps for a commercial coffee roaster customer. These are for the ceiling fixtures in their warehouse.Using the lamp manufacturer's life rating, in this application (on 10 hours a day) they should have lasted 20 years. The first one failed after 3 months, now 2 more... so one by one they are failing and rather then sending out a better quality replacement at their cost, they are issuing pro-rated credits (sigh).To me this means they do not test the lamps or source high quality products, so beware that failure might be a common experience. Also, prorating the credits is sleezy and means they do not stand behind the items they recommend.Will I buy from them again? Nope!"
"I was struggling to find purple candlestick bulbs that actually glowed purple. I ordered and returned other brands several times because they looked pink or red when plugged in. The online rep shared a link to the comments about these lights (positive reviews for purple color) so I gave them a shot. I was not disappointed! They glow a nice true purple. Thanks for the help!"
"They helped me find exactly what I needed and had been looking in dozens of stores for. Best part is it all worked exactly as offered. "
"Easy ordering good product, price and delivery."
"Extremely happy with their customer service and their pricing.Have an account with them that was set up by a different person that is no longer with my organization (didn't know the sign in username or password). I spoke with the Commercial Account Manager and he changed the login information for me and took my order. After I gave him my order, he asked if there was anything else I needed or wanted. After I told him no, he explained to me their minimum order amount and free shipping. I ended up with an extra light fixture and a case of LED bulbs for less than my original order amount."
"Products arrived as commited, were well-packed and met expectations."
"The delivery was great, ordered it on Wednesday and got it on Saturday, over Thanksgiving, could not believe it. The quality of the products are excellent. Just finished installing all the lights and everything worked out perfectly. If and when I need more lighting equipment I will definitely purchase it from this company. Thanks"
"Customer service was helpful prior to ordering the LED Customer service was helpful prior to ordering the LED Christmas lights (pure white).  Order came quickly and the lights are perfect.  First, they do not flicker, just as the phone rep had assured me. Second, they are very bright, so much so that I bought a dimmer and the lights work perfectly with dimmer.  Only negative is price, but these kind of flicker-free LED light are expensive everywhere."

"I found regular A19 incandescent bulbs at 1000bulbs.com. My intention was to buy 3 dozen bulbs. The product says \"$3.84 each.\" And just to the left in the description, it says \"12 per case.\" So I started the order. When they wanted to charge me over $14 for shipping I decided it was worth it to pay this shipping rate for 36 bulbs since the product price was so good. $28 total. HOWEVER, I received 3 bulbs in an 8x8x8 box with foam peanuts. When I called to explain and complain, they said it's made clear further down in the description. I asked for a return shipping label to return the product. They said OK. The next day I receive an email with a return address and an explanation they don't pay for return shipping and that it might not be worth returning the bulbs. Wow! I emailed back to explain that they were using deceptive marketing practices and to please pay for return shipping and refund the returned product. No communication after that. I'm guessing they know people will get confused and depend on them not wanting to pay for return shipping. What a racket!  UPDATE: Once they saw my complaint, 1000bulbs immediately sent me a refund for the product, but not the shipping (which cost more than the product). They didn't respond to a request for shipping reimbursement."
"Ordered 3 light bulbs which were delivered within a few days. When I thought it was really great was that these bulbs were packed very securely a box that was a decent size and packed very carefully with Styrofoam peanuts. The box was secure, and I was very happy that they took extra care in packaging the lightbulbs to prevent breakage. I will order again from them because I feel very confident in their product and they’re shipping"
"Before contacting 1000 Bulbs, I had tried multiple other sites and an unsuccessful trip to a big box store to find LED replacement bulbs that fit our fixture. The chat operator responded immediately to my inquiry and located two options. The order arrived very quickly and the bulbs were exactly what I needed."
"The person who answered the phone was absolutelygreat because she was patient, smart, and when she could not find an item I requested she found another source for me to go to.That's Awesome!Thank you 1000bulbs!James Truesdale"
"Crystal at 1000Bulbs communicated clearly and promptly with me so I knew what was happening with my special order, when to expect it, and also answered the phone within 2 rings-so nice not to get an automated answering machine with many questions!  I actually received my order more quickly than expected.  Definitely I will call them if I have any more electrical needs!  Very nice company!"
"1000Bulbs had the exact replacement sockets I needed to rebuild a heat lamp for my restaurant. Easy ordering, fast shipping.."
"You are an extremely efficient and superior company to do business with, from start to finish. Placing the Oder is easy, no hassle. Shipping is quick. And your packaging to keep the bulbs safe from damage is impeccable!  I have ordered from you before and was super pleased. That’s why I came back!!"
"1000Bulbs kicks ass! I got 25% off, received my order in 3 business days, and when I called for advice spoke to customer service immediately and had all my questions answered. I bought a socket spool and C7 lights for my house and it looks amazing."
"The best customer service - multiple names and numbers provided.Received order in less than four days.All bulbs lite up.Two hundred bulbs installed in less than five hours.Order Confirmation form is the best layout I have seen."
"Michael Said is a super technical adviser who helps our church on light bulbs selection. It is rare to have such a nice, knowledgeable person to help us when we need it."
"I've ordered from 1000 bulbs a few times before and always got what I wanted.  I'm reviewing them today after they DIDN'T have what I wanted.  I needed a specific kind of mini candelabra base with a \"cool\" (whiter) light.  A rep tried to find what I needed.  They didn't have it, but they referred me to a specific competitor who did have it.  THAT is customer service!"
"These guys always have the best prices on their lighting and are always helpful with our needs. They ship really quick, too.  The lights got here on Monday and were just ordered the Thursday before.  Thank you."
"Alexis Dominguez Was more than helpful. She had no issues dealing with the many changes we had and was always pleasant. Very knowledgeable and quick to respond!"
"I’ve had a difficult time finding clear bulbs for my bathroom heat lamp. They had exactly what I needed!  My order shipped quickly and was carefully packed to ensure the fragile bulbs arrived safely."
"My first time making a purchase with this company. Jordyn in customer service was very helpful with my order."
"I just received the sockets moments ago... They are of excellent quality. I would only suggest that you find a lower shipping cost. The items were overly packaged, and could easily have fit in a padded envelope."
"Finally the Christmas lights my wife has always wantedMy wife and I have been wanting to have a nice set of warm white lights lining the edge of our roof for years, I even built the house with outlets positioned to make it as clean and easy as possible, but I could never find a good dealer for high quality commercial grade cords and lights that I could customize to exact lengths, but now I have and we couldn’t be happier!!"
"The bulbs arrived in 2 days, they work beautifully, & you packed the shipment so carefully, your price was the best I've found; I bought the color changing led c9 bulbs"
"I've always had good experiences shopping here.  The prices are great and the selection is even better.  The filter tools are also well thought out to get you exactly what you're looking for."
"Order placed easy. Delivery was fast and in good condition. I made the mistake of ordering the wrong bulb.

They didn't have it, but they referred me to a specific competitor who did have it.  THAT is customer service!"

"As a contractor, I can say this is not the best place to go. I've done some level of business with 1000bulbs.com for years now. Our last project that we used 100 bulbs as a vendor will be our last purchase. Fixtures and lamps from same manufacturer at same color were not the same color lamps. We tried different products from 1000bulbs but were not able to get a color match. Had to go to one of our regular wholesalers before we could get the situation resolved. Lots of wasted time, jobsite labor and money with minimal help or real concern from the 1000bulb staff."
"Great prices, expansive selection, excellent service, and packing/delivery is exceptional!  Been using 1000Bulbs for years!"

"The salesman, Chad Pederson, the quality and ease of installment."
"Good price, product was exactly what I needed. Hard to find 5000k bulbs some times. Wish there were less expensive shipping option."
"I had a concern and they were immediately on top of it.It ended up being very minor (thank goodness). But they rectified it even though I told them it was not necessary. I will continue to use them for our light bulb needs."
"I bought their recommended 8' LED florescent replacement lamps for a commercial coffee roaster customer. These are for the ceiling fixtures in their warehouse.Using the lamp manufacturer's life rating, in this application (on 10 hours a day) they should have lasted 20 years. The first one failed after 3 months, now 2 more... so one by one they are failing and rather then sending out a better quality replacement at their cost, they are issuing pro-rated credits (sigh).To me this means they do not test the lamps or source high quality products, so beware that failure might be a common experience. Also, prorating the credits is sleezy and means they do not stand behind the items they recommend.Will I buy from them again? Nope!"
"I was struggling to find purple candlestick bulbs that actually glowed purple. I ordered and returned other brands several times because they looked pink or red when plugged in. The online rep shared a link to the comments about these lights (positive reviews for purple color) so I gave them a shot. I was not disappointed! They glow a nice true purple. Thanks for the help!"
"They helped me find exactly what I needed and had been looking in dozens of stores for. Best part is it all worked exactly as offered. "
"Easy ordering good product, price and delivery."
"Extremely happy with their customer service and their pricing.Have an account with them that was set up by a different person that is no longer with my organization (didn't know the sign in username or password). I spoke with the Commercial Account Manager and he changed the login information for me and took my order. After I gave him my order, he asked if there was anything else I needed or wanted. After I told him no, he explained to me their minimum order amount and free shipping. I ended up with an extra light fixture and a case of LED bulbs for less than my original order amount."
"Products arrived as commited, were well-packed and met expectations."
"The delivery was great, ordered it on Wednesday and got it on Saturday, over Thanksgiving, could not believe it. The quality of the products are excellent. Just finished installing all the lights and everything worked out perfectly. If and when I need more lighting equipment I will definitely purchase it from this company. Thanks"
"Customer service was helpful prior to ordering the LED Customer service was helpful prior to ordering the LED Christmas lights (pure white).  Order came quickly and the lights are perfect.  First, they do not flicker, just as the phone rep had assured me. Second, they are very bright, so much so that I bought a dimmer and the lights work perfectly with dimmer.  Only negative is price, but these kind of flicker-free LED light are expensive everywhere."

"I found regular A19 incandescent bulbs at 1000bulbs.com. My intention was to buy 3 dozen bulbs. The product says \"$3.84 each.\" And just to the left in the description, it says \"12 per case.\" So I started the order. When they wanted to charge me over $14 for shipping I decided it was worth it to pay this shipping rate for 36 bulbs since the product price was so good. $28 total. HOWEVER, I received 3 bulbs in an 8x8x8 box with foam peanuts. When I called to explain and complain, they said it's made clear further down in the description. I asked for a return shipping label to return the product. They said OK. The next day I receive an email with a return address and an explanation they don't pay for return shipping and that it might not be worth returning the bulbs. Wow! I emailed back to explain that they were using deceptive marketing practices and to please pay for return shipping and refund the returned product. No communication after that. I'm guessing they know people will get confused and depend on them not wanting to pay for return shipping. What a racket!  UPDATE: Once they saw my complaint, 1000bulbs immediately sent me a refund for the product, but not the shipping (which cost more than the product). They didn't respond to a request for shipping reimbursement."
"Ordered 3 light bulbs which were delivered within a few days. When I thought it was really great was that these bulbs were packed very securely a box that was a decent size and packed very carefully with Styrofoam peanuts. The box was secure, and I was very happy that they took extra care in packaging the lightbulbs to prevent breakage. I will order again from them because I feel very confident in their product and they’re shipping"
"Before contacting 1000 Bulbs, I had tried multiple other sites and an unsuccessful trip to a big box store to find LED replacement bulbs that fit our fixture. The chat operator responded immediately to my inquiry and located two options. The order arrived very quickly and the bulbs were exactly what I needed."
"The person who answered the phone was absolutelygreat because she was patient, smart, and when she could not find an item I requested she found another source for me to go to.That's Awesome!Thank you 1000bulbs!James Truesdale"
"Crystal at 1000Bulbs communicated clearly and promptly with me so I knew what was happening with my special order, when to expect it, and also answered the phone within 2 rings-so nice not to get an automated answering machine with many questions!  I actually received my order more quickly than expected.  Definitely I will call them if I have any more electrical needs!  Very nice company!"
"1000Bulbs had the exact replacement sockets I needed to rebuild a heat lamp for my restaurant. Easy ordering, fast shipping.."
"You are an extremely efficient and superior company to do business with, from start to finish. Placing the Oder is easy, no hassle. Shipping is quick. And your packaging to keep the bulbs safe from damage is impeccable!  I have ordered from you before and was super pleased. That’s why I came back!!"
"1000Bulbs kicks ass! I got 25% off, received my order in 3 business days, and when I called for advice spoke to customer service immediately and had all my questions answered. I bought a socket spool and C7 lights for my house and it looks amazing."
"The best customer service - multiple names and numbers provided.Received order in less than four days.All bulbs lite up.Two hundred bulbs installed in less than five hours.Order Confirmation form is the best layout I have seen."

"Extremely happy with their customer service and their pricing.Have an account with them that was set up by a different person that is no longer with my organization (didn't know the sign in username or password). I spoke with the Commercial Account Manager and he changed the login information for me and took my order. After I gave him my order, he asked if there was anything else I needed or wanted. After I told him no, he explained to me their minimum order amount and free shipping. I ended up with an extra light fixture and a case of LED bulbs for less than my original order amount."
"Products arrived as commited, were well-packed and met expectations."
"The delivery was great, ordered it on Wednesday and got it on Saturday, over Thanksgiving, could not believe it. The quality of the products are excellent. Just finished installing all the lights and everything worked out perfectly. If and when I need more lighting equipment I will definitely purchase it from this company. Thanks"
"Customer service was helpful prior to ordering the LED Customer service was helpful prior to ordering the LED Christmas lights (pure white).  Order came quickly and the lights are perfect.  First, they do not flicker, just as the phone rep had assured me. Second, they are very bright, so much so that I bought a dimmer and the lights work perfectly with dimmer.  Only negative is price, but these kind of flicker-free LED light are expensive everywhere."
"I found regular A19 incandescent bulbs at 1000bulbs.com. My intention was to buy 3 dozen bulbs. The product says \"$3.84 each.\" And just to the left in the description, it says \"12 per case.\" So I started the order. When they wanted to charge me over $14 for shipping I decided it was worth it to pay this shipping rate for 36 bulbs since the product price was so good. $28 total. HOWEVER, I received 3 bulbs in an 8x8x8 box with foam peanuts. When I called to explain and complain, they said it's made clear further down in the description. I asked for a return shipping label to return the product. They said OK. The next day I receive an email with a return address and an explanation they don't pay for return shipping and that it might not be worth returning the bulbs. Wow! I emailed back to explain that they were using deceptive marketing practices and to please pay for return shipping and refund the returned product. No communication after that. I'm guessing they know people will get confused and depend on them not wanting to pay for return shipping. What a racket!  UPDATE: Once they saw my complaint, 1000bulbs immediately sent me a refund for the product, but not the shipping (which cost more than the product). They didn't respond to a request for shipping reimbursement."
"Ordered 3 light bulbs which were delivered within a few days. When I thought it was really great was that these bulbs were packed very securely a box that was a decent size and packed very carefully with Styrofoam peanuts. The box was secure, and I was very happy that they took extra care in packaging the lightbulbs to prevent breakage. I will order again from them because I feel very confident in their product and they’re shipping"
"Before contacting 1000 Bulbs, I had tried multiple other sites and an unsuccessful trip to a big box store to find LED replacement bulbs that fit our fixture. The chat operator responded immediately to my inquiry and located two options. The order arrived very quickly and the bulbs were exactly what I needed."
"The person who answered the phone was absolutelygreat because she was patient, smart, and when she could not find an item I requested she found another source for me to go to.That's Awesome!Thank you 1000bulbs!James Truesdale"
"Crystal at 1000Bulbs communicated clearly and promptly with me so I knew what was happening with my special order, when to expect it, and also answered the phone within 2 rings-so nice not to get an automated answering machine with many questions!  I actually received my order more quickly than expected.  Definitely I will call them if I have any more electrical needs!  Very nice company!"
"1000Bulbs had the exact replacement sockets I needed to rebuild a heat lamp for my restaurant. Easy ordering, fast shipping.."
"You are an extremely efficient and superior company to do business with, from start to finish. Placing the Oder is easy, no hassle. Shipping is quick.

"1000Bulbs kicks ass! I got 25% off, received my order in 3 business days, and when I called for advice spoke to customer service immediately and had all my questions answered. I bought a socket spool and C7 lights for my house and it looks amazing."
"The best customer service - multiple names and numbers provided.Received order in less than four days.All bulbs lite up.Two hundred bulbs installed in less than five hours.Order Confirmation form is the best layout I have seen."
"Michael Said is a super technical adviser who helps our church on light bulbs selection. It is rare to have such a nice, knowledgeable person to help us when we need it."
"I've ordered from 1000 bulbs a few times before and always got what I wanted.  I'm reviewing them today after they DIDN'T have what I wanted.  I needed a specific kind of mini candelabra base with a \"cool\" (whiter) light.  A rep tried to find what I needed.  They didn't have it, but they referred me to a specific competitor who did have it.  THAT is customer service!"
"These guys always have the best prices on their lighting and are always helpful with our needs. They ship really quick, too.  The lights got here on Monday and were just ordered the Thursday before.  Thank you."

"My first time making a purchase with this company. Jordyn in customer service was very helpful with my order."
"I just received the sockets moments ago... They are of excellent quality. I would only suggest that you find a lower shipping cost. The items were overly packaged, and could easily have fit in a padded envelope."
"Finally the Christmas lights my wife has always wantedMy wife and I have been wanting to have a nice set of warm white lights lining the edge of our roof for years, I even built the house with outlets positioned to make it as clean and easy as possible, but I could never find a good dealer for high quality commercial grade cords and lights that I could customize to exact lengths, but now I have and we couldn’t be happier!!"
"The bulbs arrived in 2 days, they work beautifully, & you packed the shipment so carefully, your price was the best I've found; I bought the color changing led c9 bulbs"
"I've always had good experiences shopping here.  The prices are great and the selection is even better.  The filter tools are also well thought out to get you exactly what you're looking for."

"Ease of use for web-based shopping and online customer support via chat."

"Chad was extremely helpful finding us a new light bulb for our garage door openers since our last ones were banned from the US. Great customer service!!"
"They had less common bulb types that I needed from a name brand manufacturer and delivered in a short period of time."
"Easily found a repair part for a 40 year old microscope!Big thanks to customer service for quickly taking care of my tax exemption!"
"I was able to get all my questions answered by using the website. I purchased them at a better price than elsewhere, and my bulbs were shipped the next day. Now, shipping was a pain because it was FedEx only."
"I ordered a case of 40 46 inch flourecent bulbs arriving fast and best deal I could find. So far ist time buyer very pleased."
"1000Bulbs has been great to work with on every occasion.  After processing a replacement under warranty recently, I was impressed by the level of care, timeliness, and thoroughness they exhibited."
"I put the 150 foot rope lights throughout the yard, suspended to stainless steel cables, fastened every 12 inches and they came out great!"
"I have been a repeat customer for years.  Great products, always a good selection, items are well packed and delivered quickly.  I will always look to 1000Bulbs for my lighting needs!"

"Easy to find various options searching site for LED replacements for dual mini-flourescents with full specs listed, including base type, color (warmth), brightness (lumens), and interface (direct A/C and w/ballast and compatible with both).  Good price, and quick delivery.  Got exactly want I expected, site made it easy to reach and compare, and the LED replacement bulbs fit & works perfectly."

"For difficult to find bulbs especially LED replacements, 1000bulbs is the best. Their online interface is easy to use and fast. Shipping is expensive but fair and quick. All around good experience."
"As a contractor, I can say this is not the best place to go. I've done some level of business with 1000bulbs.com for years now. Our last project that we used 100 bulbs as a vendor will be our last purchase. Fixtures and lamps from same manufacturer at same color were not the same color lamps. We tried different products from 1000bulbs but were not able to get a color match. Had to go to one of our regular wholesalers before we could get the situation resolved. Lots of wasted time, jobsite labor and money with minimal help or real concern from the 1000bulb staff."
"Great prices, expansive selection, excellent service, and packing/delivery is exceptional!  Been using 1000Bulbs for years!"
"Outstanding Custer service.  It’s always a pleasure doing business with a team of experts.  When you get a great company like this and the “same” advisor that knows you by name, you have a known quantity that understands you and your needs!  Great customer service and Connor is out representing the company and its values.  Bob Effler"
"I have ordered from 1000Bulbs.com before and that is why I returned for a new set of specialty bulbs for some new fixtures I installed in my kitchen. The bulbs arrived very well packaged and all were functional."
"The salesman, Chad Pederson, the quality and ease of installment."
"Good price, product was exactly what I needed. Hard to find 5000k bulbs some times. Wish there were less expensive shipping option."
"I had a concern and they were immediately on top of it.It ended up being very minor (thank goodness). But they rectified it even though I told them it was not necessary. I will continue to use them for our light bulb needs."
"I bought their recommended 8' LED florescent replacement lamps for a commercial coffee roaster customer. These are for the ceiling fixtures in their warehouse.Using the lamp manufacturer's life rating, in this application (on 10 hours a day) they should have lasted 20 years. The first one failed after 3 months, now 2 more... so one by one they are failing and rather then sending out a better quality replacement at their cost, they are issuing pro-rated credits (sigh).To me this means they do not test the lamps or source high quality products, so beware that failure might be a common experience. Also, prorating the credits is sleezy and means they do not stand behind the items they recommend.Will I buy from them again? Nope!"
"I was struggling to find purple candlestick bulbs that actually glowed purple. I ordered and returned other brands several times because they looked pink or red when plugged in. The online rep shared a link to the comments about these lights (positive reviews for purple color) so I gave them a shot. I was not disappointed! They glow a nice true purple. Thanks for the help!"
"They helped me find exactly what I needed and had been looking in dozens of stores for. Best part is it all worked exactly as offered. "
"Easy ordering good product, price and delivery."
"Extremely happy with their customer service and their pricing.Have an account with them that was set up by a different person that is no longer with my organization (didn't know the sign in username or password).

Lots of wasted time, jobsite labor and money with minimal help or real concern from the 1000bulb staff."
"Great prices, expansive selection, excellent service, and packing/delivery is exceptional!  Been using 1000Bulbs for years!"
"Outstanding Custer service.  It’s always a pleasure doing business with a team of experts.  When you get a great company like this and the “same” advisor that knows you by name, you have a known quantity that understands you and your needs!  Great customer service and Connor is out representing the company and its values.  Bob Effler"
"I have ordered from 1000Bulbs.com before and that is why I returned for a new set of specialty bulbs for some new fixtures I installed in my kitchen. The bulbs arrived very well packaged and all were functional."
"The salesman, Chad Pederson, the quality and ease of installment."
"Good price, product was exactly what I needed. Hard to find 5000k bulbs some times. Wish there were less expensive shipping option."
"I had a concern and they were immediately on top of it.It ended up being very minor (thank goodness). But they rectified it even though I told them it was not necessary. I will continue to use them for our light bulb needs."
"I bought their recommended 8' LED florescent replacement lamps for a commercial coffee roaster customer. These are for the ceiling fixtures in their warehouse.Using the lamp manufacturer's life rating, in this application (on 10 hours a day) they should have lasted 20 years. The first one failed after 3 months, now 2 more... so one by one they are failing and rather then sending out a better quality replacement at their cost, they are issuing pro-rated credits (sigh).To me this means they do not test the lamps or source high quality products, so beware that failure might be a common experience. Also, prorating the credits is sleezy and means they do not stand behind the items they recommend.Will I buy from them again? Nope!"
"I was struggling to find purple candlestick bulbs that actually glowed purple. I ordered and returned other brands several times because they looked pink or red when plugged in. The online rep shared a link to the comments about these lights (positive reviews for purple color) so I gave them a shot. I was not disappointed! They glow a nice true purple. Thanks for the help!"
"They helped me find exactly what I needed and had been looking in dozens of stores for. Best part is it all worked exactly as offered. "
"Easy ordering good product, price and delivery."
"Extremely happy with their customer service and their pricing.Have an account with them that was set up by a different person that is no longer with my organization (didn't know the sign in username or password). I spoke with the Commercial Account Manager and he changed the login information for me and took my order. After I gave him my order, he asked if there was anything else I needed or wanted. After I told him no, he explained to me their minimum order amount and free shipping. I ended up with an extra light fixture and a case of LED bulbs for less than my original order amount."
"Products arrived as commited, were well-packed and met expectations."
"The delivery was great, ordered it on Wednesday and got it on Saturday, over Thanksgiving, could not believe it. The quality of the products are excellent. Just finished installing all the lights and everything worked out perfectly. If and when I need more lighting equipment I will definitely purchase it from this company. Thanks"
"Customer service was helpful prior to ordering the LED Customer service was helpful prior to ordering the LED Christmas lights (pure white).  Order came quickly and the lights are perfect.  First, they do not flicker, just as the phone rep had assured me. Second, they are very bright, so much so that I bought a dimmer and the lights work perfectly with dimmer.  Only negative is price, but these kind of flicker-free LED light are expensive everywhere."
"I found regular A19 incandescent bulbs at 1000bulbs.com. My intention was to buy 3 dozen bulbs. The product says \"$3.84 each.\" And just to the left in the description, it says \"12 per case.\" So I started the order. When they wanted to charge me over $14 for shipping I decided it was worth it to pay this shipping rate for 36 bulbs since the product price was so good. $28 total. HOWEVER, I received 3 bulbs in an 8x8x8 box with foam peanuts. When I called to explain and complain, they said it's made clear further down in the description. I asked for a return shipping label to return the product. They said OK. The next day I receive an email with a return address and an explanation they don't pay for return shipping and that it might not be worth returning the bulbs. Wow! I emailed back to explain that they were using deceptive marketing practices and to please pay for return shipping and refund the returned product. No communication after that. I'm guessing they know people will get confused and depend on them not wanting to pay for return shipping. What a racket!  UPDATE: Once they saw my complaint, 1000bulbs immediately sent me a refund for the product, but not the shipping (which cost more than the product). They didn't respond to a request for shipping reimbursement."
"Ordered 3 light bulbs which were delivered within a few days. When I thought it was really great was that these bulbs were packed very securely a box that was a decent size and packed very carefully with Styrofoam peanuts. The box was secure, and I was very happy that they took extra care in packaging the lightbulbs to prevent breakage. I will order again from them because I feel very confident in their product and they’re shipping"
"Before contacting 1000 Bulbs, I had tried multiple other sites and an unsuccessful trip to a big box store to find LED replacement bulbs that fit our fixture. The chat operator responded immediately to my inquiry and located two options. The order arrived very quickly and the bulbs were exactly what I needed."

"I've ordered from 1000 bulbs a few times before and always got what I wanted.  I'm reviewing them today after they DIDN'T have what I wanted.  I needed a specific kind of mini candelabra base with a \"cool\" (whiter) light.  A rep tried to find what I needed.

"I've always had good experiences shopping here.  The prices are great and the selection is even better.  The filter tools are also well thought out to get you exactly what you're looking for."
"Order placed easy. Delivery was fast and in good condition. I made the mistake of ordering the wrong bulb. I was very disappointed that I couldn't return the item for exchange without paying a large amount of money. That's something I think may be helpful to change. But I was truly glad to find what I needed at your company"
"Alexis was extremely helpful and professional. She took her time to listen to my needs and sent price quotes promptly. Also. I needed help with tax exemption of which she was able to help. I received my globes in a very timely manner!!"
"Easy to find various options searching site for LED replacements for dual mini-flourescents with full specs listed, including base type, color (warmth), brightness (lumens), and interface (direct A/C and w/ballast and compatible with both).  Good price, and quick delivery.  Got exactly want I expected, site made it easy to reach and compare, and the LED replacement bulbs fit & works perfectly."
"Shipped in time but unfortunately my bulbs was damaged during transport but Kristin and Pam reacted super fast on my claim and send replacements! "
"For difficult to find bulbs especially LED replacements, 1000bulbs is the best. Their online interface is easy to use and fast. Shipping is expensive but fair and quick. All around good experience."
"As a contractor, I can say this is not the best place to go. I've done some level of business with 1000bulbs.com for years now. Our last project that we used 100 bulbs as a vendor will be our last purchase. Fixtures and lamps from same manufacturer at same color were not the same color lamps. We tried different products from 1000bulbs but were not able to get a color match. Had to go to one of our regular wholesalers before we could get the situation resolved. Lots of wasted time, jobsite labor and money with minimal help or real concern from the 1000bulb staff."
"Great prices, expansive selection, excellent service, and packing/delivery is exceptional!  Been using 1000Bulbs for years!"
"Outstanding Custer service.  It’s always a pleasure doing business with a team of experts.  When you get a great company like this and the “same” advisor that knows you by name, you have a known quantity that understands you and your needs!  Great customer service and Connor is out representing the company and its values.  Bob Effler"
"I have ordered from 1000Bulbs.com before and that is why I returned for a new set of specialty bulbs for some new fixtures I installed in my kitchen. The bulbs arrived very well packaged and all were functional."
"The salesman, Chad Pederson, the quality and ease of installment."
"Good price, product was exactly what I needed. Hard to find 5000k bulbs some times. Wish there were less expensive shipping option."
"I had a concern and they were immediately on top of it.It ended up being very minor (thank goodness). But they rectified it even though I told them it was not necessary. I will continue to use them for our light bulb needs."
"I bought their recommended 8' LED florescent replacement lamps for a commercial coffee roaster customer. These are for the ceiling fixtures in their warehouse.Using the lamp manufacturer's life rating, in this application (on 10 hours a day) they should have lasted 20 years. The first one failed after 3 months, now 2 more... so one by one they are failing and rather then sending out a better quality replacement at their cost, they are issuing pro-rated credits (sigh).To me this means they do not test the lamps or source high quality products, so beware that failure might be a common experience. Also, prorating the credits is sleezy and means they do not stand behind the items they recommend.Will I buy from them again? Nope!"
"I was struggling to find purple candlestick bulbs that actually glowed purple. I ordered and returned other brands several times because they looked pink or red when plugged in. The online rep shared a link to the comments about these lights (positive reviews for purple color) so I gave them a shot. I was not disappointed! They glow a nice true purple. Thanks for the help!"
"They helped me find exactly what I needed and had been looking in dozens of stores for. Best part is it all worked exactly as offered. "
"Easy ordering good product, price and delivery."
"Extremely happy with their customer service and their pricing.Have an account with them that was set up by a different person that is no longer with my organization (didn't know the sign in username or password). I spoke with the Commercial Account Manager and he changed the login information for me and took my order. After I gave him my order, he asked if there was anything else I needed or wanted. After I told him no, he explained to me their minimum order amount and free shipping. I ended up with an extra light fixture and a case of LED bulbs for less than my original order amount."
"Products arrived as commited, were well-packed and met expectations."
"The delivery was great, ordered it on Wednesday and got it on Saturday, over Thanksgiving, could not believe it. The quality of the products are excellent. Just finished installing all the lights and everything worked out perfectly. If and when I need more lighting equipment I will definitely purchase it from this company. Thanks"
"Customer service was helpful prior to ordering the LED Customer service was helpful prior to ordering the LED Christmas lights (pure white).  Order came quickly and the lights are perfect.  First, they do not flicker, just as the phone rep had assured me. Second, they are very bright, so much so that I bought a dimmer and the lights work perfectly with dimmer.  Only negative is price, but these kind of flicker-free LED light are expensive everywhere."

"I found regular A19 incandescent bulbs at 1000bulbs.com. My intention was to buy 3 dozen bulbs. The product says \"$3.84 each.\" And just to the left in the description, it says \"12 per case.\" So I started the order. When they wanted to charge me over $14 for shipping I decided it was worth it to pay this shipping rate for 36 bulbs since the product price was so good. $28 total. HOWEVER, I received 3 bulbs in an 8x8x8 box with foam peanuts. When I called to explain and complain, they said it's made clear further down in the description. I asked for a return shipping label to return the product. They said OK. The next day I receive an email with a return address and an explanation they don't pay for return shipping and that it might not be worth returning the bulbs. Wow! I emailed back to explain that they were using deceptive marketing practices and to please pay for return shipping and refund the returned product. No communication after that. I'm guessing they know people will get confused and depend on them not wanting to pay for return shipping. What a racket!  UPDATE: Once they saw my complaint, 1000bulbs immediately sent me a refund for the product, but not the shipping (which cost more than the product). They didn't respond to a request for shipping reimbursement."
"Ordered 3 light bulbs which were delivered within a few days. When I thought it was really great was that these bulbs were packed very securely a box that was a decent size and packed very carefully with Styrofoam peanuts. The box was secure, and I was very happy that they took extra care in packaging the lightbulbs to prevent breakage. I will order again from them because I feel very confident in their product and they’re shipping"
"Before contacting 1000 Bulbs, I had tried multiple other sites and an unsuccessful trip to a big box store to find LED replacement bulbs that fit our fixture. The chat operator responded immediately to my inquiry and located two options. The order arrived very quickly and the bulbs were exactly what I needed."
"The person who answered the phone was absolutelygreat because she was patient, smart, and when she could not find an item I requested she found another source for me to go to.That's Awesome!Thank you 1000bulbs!James Truesdale"
"Crystal at 1000Bulbs communicated clearly and promptly with me so I knew what was happening with my special order, when to expect it, and also answered the phone within 2 rings-so nice not to get an automated answering machine with many questions!  I actually received my order more quickly than expected.  Definitely I will call them if I have any more electrical needs!  Very nice company!"
"1000Bulbs had the exact replacement sockets I needed to rebuild a heat lamp for my restaurant. Easy ordering, fast shipping.."

"The best customer service - multiple names and numbers provided.Received order in less than four days.All bulbs lite up.Two hundred bulbs installed in less than five hours.Order Confirmation form is the best layout I have seen."
"Michael Said is a super technical adviser who helps our church on light bulbs selection. It is rare to have such a nice, knowledgeable person to help us when we need it."
"I've ordered from 1000 bulbs a few times before and always got what I wanted.  I'm reviewing them today after they DIDN'T have what I wanted.  I needed a specific kind of mini candelabra base with a \"cool\" (whiter) light.  A rep tried to find what I needed.  They didn't have it, but they referred me to a specific competitor who did have it.  THAT is customer service!"
"These guys always have the best prices on their lighting and are always helpful with our needs. They ship really quick, too.  The lights got here on Monday and were just ordered the Thursday before.  Thank you."
"Alexis Dominguez Was more than helpful. She had no issues dealing with the many changes we had and was always pleasant. Very knowledgeable and quick to respond!"
"I’ve had a difficult time finding clear bulbs for my bathroom heat lamp. They had exactly what I needed!  My order shipped quickly and was carefully packed to ensure the fragile bulbs arrived safely."
"My first time making a purchase with this company. Jordyn in customer service was very helpful with my order."
"I just received the sockets moments ago... They are of excellent quality. I would only suggest that you find a lower shipping cost. The items were overly packaged, and could easily have fit in a padded envelope."
"Finally the Christmas lights my wife has always wantedMy wife and I have been wanting to have a nice set of warm white lights lining the edge of our roof for years, I even built the house with outlets positioned to make it as clean and easy as possible, but I could never find a good dealer for high quality commercial grade cords and lights that I could customize to exact lengths, but now I have and we couldn’t be happier!!"

"Chad was extremely helpful finding us a new light bulb for our garage door openers since our last ones were banned from the US. Great customer service!!"
"They had less common bulb types that I needed from a name brand manufacturer and delivered in a short period of time."
"Easily found a repair part for a 40 year old microscope!Big thanks to customer service for quickly taking care of my tax exemption!"

"1000Bulbs had the exact replacement sockets I needed to rebuild a heat lamp for my restaurant. Easy ordering, fast shipping.."
"You are an extremely efficient and superior company to do business with, from start to finish. Placing the Oder is easy, no hassle. Shipping is quick. And your packaging to keep the bulbs safe from damage is impeccable!  I have ordered from you before and was super pleased. That’s why I came back!!"
"1000Bulbs kicks ass! I got 25% off, received my order in 3 business days, and when I called for advice spoke to customer service immediately and had all my questions answered. I bought a socket spool and C7 lights for my house and it looks amazing."
"The best customer service - multiple names and numbers provided.Received order in less than four days.All bulbs lite up.Two hundred bulbs installed in less than five hours.Order Confirmation form is the best layout I have seen."
"Michael Said is a super technical adviser who helps our church on light bulbs selection. It is rare to have such a nice, knowledgeable person to help us when we need it."
"I've ordered from 1000 bulbs a few times before and always got what I wanted.  I'm reviewing them today after they DIDN'T have what I wanted.  I needed a specific kind of mini candelabra base with a \"cool\" (whiter) light.  A rep tried to find what I needed.  They didn't have it, but they referred me to a specific competitor who did have it.  THAT is customer service!"
"These guys always have the best prices on their lighting and are always helpful with our needs. They ship really quick, too.  The lights got here on Monday and were just ordered the Thursday before.  Thank you."
"Alexis Dominguez Was more than helpful. She had no issues dealing with the many changes we had and was always pleasant. Very knowledgeable and quick to respond!"
"I’ve had a difficult time finding clear bulbs for my bathroom heat lamp. They had exactly what I needed!  My order shipped quickly and was carefully packed to ensure the fragile bulbs arrived safely."
"My first time making a purchase with this company. Jordyn in customer service was very helpful with my order."
"I just received the sockets moments ago... They are of excellent quality. I would only suggest that you find a lower shipping cost. The items were overly packaged, and could easily have fit in a padded envelope."
"Finally the Christmas lights my wife has always wantedMy wife and I have been wanting to have a nice set of warm white lights lining the edge of our roof for years, I even built the house with outlets positioned to make it as clean and easy as possible, but I could never find a good dealer for high quality commercial grade cords and lights that I could customize to exact lengths, but now I have and we couldn’t be happier!!"
"The bulbs arrived in 2 days, they work beautifully, & you packed the shipment so carefully, your price was the best I've found; I bought the color changing led c9 bulbs"
"I've always had good experiences shopping here.  The prices are great and the selection is even better.  The filter tools are also well thought out to get you exactly what you're looking for."
"Order placed easy. Delivery was fast and in good condition. I made the mistake of ordering the wrong bulb. I was very disappointed that I couldn't return the item for exchange without paying a large amount of money. That's something I think may be helpful to change. But I was truly glad to find what I needed at your company"
"Alexis was extremely helpful and professional. She took her time to listen to my needs and sent price quotes promptly. Also. I needed help with tax exemption of which she was able to help. I received my globes in a very timely manner!!"
"Easy to find various options searching site for LED replacements for dual mini-flourescents with full specs listed, including base type, color (warmth), brightness (lumens), and interface (direct A/C and w/ballast and compatible with both).  Good price, and quick delivery.  Got exactly want I expected, site made it easy to reach and compare, and the LED replacement bulbs fit & works perfectly."
"Shipped in time but unfortunately my bulbs was damaged during transport but Kristin and Pam reacted super fast on my claim and send replacements! "
"For difficult to find bulbs especially LED replacements, 1000bulbs is the best. Their online interface is easy to use and fast. Shipping is expensive but fair and quick. All around good experience."
"As a contractor, I can say this is not the best place to go. I've done some level of business with 1000bulbs.com for years now. Our last project that we used 100 bulbs as a vendor will be our last purchase. Fixtures and lamps from same manufacturer at same color were not the same color lamps. We tried different products from 1000bulbs but were not able to get a color match. Had to go to one of our regular wholesalers before we could get the situation resolved. Lots of wasted time, jobsite labor and money with minimal help or real concern from the 1000bulb staff."
"Great prices, expansive selection, excellent service, and packing/delivery is exceptional!  Been using 1000Bulbs for years!"
"Outstanding Custer service.  It’s always a pleasure doing business with a team of experts.  When you get a great company like this and the “same” advisor that knows you by name, you have a known quantity that understands you and your needs!  Great customer service and Connor is out representing the company and its values.  Bob Effler"
"I have ordered from 1000Bulbs.com before and that is why I returned for a new set of specialty bulbs for some new fixtures I installed in my kitchen. The bulbs arrived very well packaged and all were functional."
"The salesman, Chad Pederson, the quality and ease of installment."
"Good price, product was exactly what I needed. Hard to find 5000k bulbs some times. Wish there were less expensive shipping option."
"I had a concern and they were immediately on top of it.It ended up being very minor (thank goodness). But they rectified it even though I told them it was not necessary. I will continue to use them for our light bulb needs."
"I bought their recommended 8' LED florescent replacement lamps for a commercial coffee roaster customer. These are for the ceiling fixtures in their warehouse.Using the lamp manufacturer's life rating, in this application (on 10 hours a day) they should have lasted 20 years. The first one failed after 3 months, now 2 more... so one by one they are failing and rather then sending out a better quality replacement at their cost, they are issuing pro-rated credits (sigh).To me this means they do not test the lamps or source high quality products, so beware that failure might be a common experience. Also, prorating the credits is sleezy and means they do not stand behind the items they recommend.Will I buy from them again? Nope!"
"I was struggling to find purple candlestick bulbs that actually glowed purple. I ordered and returned other brands several times because they looked pink or red when plugged in. The online rep shared a link to the comments about these lights (positive reviews for purple color) so I gave them a shot. I was not disappointed! They glow a nice true purple. Thanks for the help!"
"They helped me find exactly what I needed and had been looking in dozens of stores for. Best part is it all worked exactly as offered. "
"Easy ordering good product, price and delivery."
"Extremely happy with their customer service and their pricing.Have an account with them that was set up by a different person that is no longer with my organization (didn't know the sign in username or password). I spoke with the Commercial Account Manager and he changed the login information for me and took my order. After I gave him my order, he asked if there was anything else I needed or wanted. After I told him no, he explained to me their minimum order amount and free shipping. I ended up with an extra light fixture and a case of LED bulbs for less than my original order amount."
"Products arrived as commited, were well-packed and met expectations."
"The delivery was great, ordered it on Wednesday and got it on Saturday, over Thanksgiving, could not believe it. The quality of the products are excellent. Just finished installing all the lights and everything worked out perfectly. If and when I need more lighting equipment I will definitely purchase it from this company. Thanks"
"Customer service was helpful prior to ordering the LED Customer service was helpful prior to ordering the LED Christmas lights (pure white).  Order came quickly and the lights are perfect.  First, they do not flicker, just as the phone rep had assured me. Second, they are very bright, so much so that I bought a dimmer and the lights work perfectly with dimmer.  Only negative is price, but these kind of flicker-free LED light are expensive everywhere."

"I found regular A19 incandescent bulbs at 1000bulbs.com. My intention was to buy 3 dozen bulbs. The product says \"$3.84 each.\" And just to the left in the description, it says \"12 per case.\" So I started the order. When they wanted to charge me over $14 for shipping I decided it was worth it to pay this shipping rate for 36 bulbs since the product price was so good. $28 total. HOWEVER, I received 3 bulbs in an 8x8x8 box with foam peanuts. When I called to explain and complain, they said it's made clear further down in the description. I asked for a return shipping label to return the product. They said OK. The next day I receive an email with a return address and an explanation they don't pay for return shipping and that it might not be worth returning the bulbs. Wow! I emailed back to explain that they were using deceptive marketing practices and to please pay for return shipping and refund the returned product. No communication after that. I'm guessing they know people will get confused and depend on them not wanting to pay for return shipping. What a racket!  UPDATE: Once they saw my complaint, 1000bulbs immediately sent me a refund for the product, but not the shipping (which cost more than the product). They didn't respond to a request for shipping reimbursement."
"Ordered 3 light bulbs which were delivered within a few days. When I thought it was really great was that these bulbs were packed very securely a box that was a decent size and packed very carefully with Styrofoam peanuts. The box was secure, and I was very happy that they took extra care in packaging the lightbulbs to prevent breakage. I will order again from them because I feel very confident in their product and they’re shipping"
"Before contacting 1000 Bulbs, I had tried multiple other sites and an unsuccessful trip to a big box store to find LED replacement bulbs that fit our fixture. The chat operator responded immediately to my inquiry and located two options. The order arrived very quickly and the bulbs were exactly what I needed."
"The person who answered the phone was absolutelygreat because she was patient, smart, and when she could not find an item I requested she found another source for me to go to.That's Awesome!Thank you 1000bulbs!James Truesdale"

"I bought their recommended 8' LED florescent replacement lamps for a commercial coffee roaster customer. These are for the ceiling fixtures in their warehouse.Using the lamp manufacturer's life rating, in this application (on 10 hours a day) they should have lasted 20 years. The first one failed after 3 months, now 2 more... so one by one they are failing and rather then sending out a better quality replacement at their cost, they are issuing pro-rated credits (sigh).To me this means they do not test the lamps or source high quality products, so beware that failure might be a common experience. Also, prorating the credits is sleezy and means they do not stand behind the items they recommend.Will I buy from them again? Nope!"
"I was struggling to find purple candlestick bulbs that actually glowed purple. I ordered and returned other brands several times because they looked pink or red when plugged in. The online rep shared a link to the comments about these lights (positive reviews for purple color) so I gave them a shot. I was not disappointed! They glow a nice true purple. Thanks for the help!"
"They helped me find exactly what I needed and had been looking in dozens of stores for. Best part is it all worked exactly as offered. "
"Easy ordering good product, price and delivery."
"Extremely happy with their customer service and their pricing.Have an account with them that was set up by a different person that is no longer with my organization (didn't know the sign in username or password). I spoke with the Commercial Account Manager and he changed the login information for me and took my order. After I gave him my order, he asked if there was anything else I needed or wanted. After I told him no, he explained to me their minimum order amount and free shipping. I ended up with an extra light fixture and a case of LED bulbs for less than my original order amount."
"Products arrived as commited, were well-packed and met expectations."
"The delivery was great, ordered it on Wednesday and got it on Saturday, over Thanksgiving, could not believe it. The quality of the products are excellent. Just finished installing all the lights and everything worked out perfectly. If and when I need more lighting equipment I will definitely purchase it from this company. Thanks"
"Customer service was helpful prior to ordering the LED Customer service was helpful prior to ordering the LED Christmas lights (pure white).  Order came quickly and the lights are perfect.  First, they do not flicker, just as the phone rep had assured me. Second, they are very bright, so much so that I bought a dimmer and the lights work perfectly with dimmer.  Only negative is price, but these kind of flicker-free LED light are expensive everywhere."
"I found regular A19 incandescent bulbs at 1000bulbs.com. My intention was to buy 3 dozen bulbs. The product says \"$3.84 each.\" And just to the left in the description, it says \"12 per case.\" So I started the order. When they wanted to charge me over $14 for shipping I decided it was worth it to pay this shipping rate for 36 bulbs since the product price was so good. $28 total. HOWEVER, I received 3 bulbs in an 8x8x8 box with foam peanuts. When I called to explain and complain, they said it's made clear further down in the description. I asked for a return shipping label to return the product. They said OK. The next day I receive an email with a return address and an explanation they don't pay for return shipping and that it might not be worth returning the bulbs. Wow! I emailed back to explain that they were using deceptive marketing practices and to please pay for return shipping and refund the returned product. No communication after that. I'm guessing they know people will get confused and depend on them not wanting to pay for return shipping. What a racket!  UPDATE: Once they saw my complaint, 1000bulbs immediately sent me a refund for the product, but not the shipping (which cost more than the product). They didn't respond to a request for shipping reimbursement."
"Ordered 3 light bulbs which were delivered within a few days. When I thought it was really great was that these bulbs were packed very securely a box that was a decent size and packed very carefully with Styrofoam peanuts. The box was secure, and I was very happy that they took extra care in packaging the lightbulbs to prevent breakage. I will order again from them because I feel very confident in their product and they’re shipping"
"Before contacting 1000 Bulbs, I had tried multiple other sites and an unsuccessful trip to a big box store to find LED replacement bulbs that fit our fixture. The chat operator responded immediately to my inquiry and located two options. The order arrived very quickly and the bulbs were exactly what I needed."
"The person who answered the phone was absolutelygreat because she was patient, smart, and when she could not find an item I requested she found another source for me to go to.That's Awesome!Thank you 1000bulbs!James Truesdale"
"Crystal at 1000Bulbs communicated clearly and promptly with me so I knew what was happening with my special order, when to expect it, and also answered the phone within 2 rings-so nice not to get an automated answering machine with many questions!  I actually received my order more quickly than expected.  Definitely I will call them if I have any more electrical needs!  Very nice company!"
"1000Bulbs had the exact replacement sockets I needed to rebuild a heat lamp for my restaurant. Easy ordering, fast shipping.."
"You are an extremely efficient and superior company to do business with, from start to finish. Placing the Oder is easy, no hassle. Shipping is quick. And your packaging to keep the bulbs safe from damage is impeccable!  I have ordered from you before and was super pleased. That’s why I came back!!"
"1000Bulbs kicks ass! I got 25% off, received my order in 3 business days, and when I called for advice spoke to customer service immediately and had all my questions answered. I bought a socket spool and C7 lights for my house and it looks amazing."
"The best customer service - multiple names and numbers provided.Received order in less than four days.All bulbs lite up.Two hundred bulbs installed in less than five hours.Order Confirmation form is the best layout I have seen."
"Michael Said is a super technical adviser who helps our church on light bulbs selection. It is rare to have such a nice, knowledgeable person to help us when we need it."
"I've ordered from 1000 bulbs a few times before and always got what I wanted.  I'm reviewing them today after they DIDN'T have what I wanted.  I needed a specific kind of mini candelabra base with a \"cool\" (whiter) light.  A rep tried to find what I needed.  They didn't have it, but they referred me to a specific competitor who did have it.  THAT is customer service!"
"These guys always have the best prices on their lighting and are always helpful with our needs. They ship really quick, too.  The lights got here on Monday and were just ordered the Thursday before.  Thank you."
"Alexis Dominguez Was more than helpful. She had no issues dealing with the many changes we had and was always pleasant. Very knowledgeable and quick to respond!"
"I’ve had a difficult time finding clear bulbs for my bathroom heat lamp. They had exactly what I needed!  My order shipped quickly and was carefully packed to ensure the fragile bulbs arrived safely."
"My first time making a purchase with this company. Jordyn in customer service was very helpful with my order."
"I just received the sockets moments ago... They are of excellent quality. I would only suggest that you find a lower shipping cost. The items were overly packaged, and could easily have fit in a padded envelope."
"Finally the Christmas lights my wife has always wantedMy wife and I have been wanting to have a nice set of warm white lights lining the edge of our roof for years, I even built the house with outlets positioned to make it as clean and easy as possible, but I could never find a good dealer for high quality commercial grade cords and lights that I could customize to exact lengths, but now I have and we couldn’t be happier!!"
"The bulbs arrived in 2 days, they work beautifully, & you packed the shipment so carefully, your price was the best I've found; I bought the color changing led c9 bulbs"
"I've always had good experiences shopping here.  The prices are great and the selection is even better.  The filter tools are also well thought out to get you exactly what you're looking for."
"Order placed easy. Delivery was fast and in good condition. I made the mistake of ordering the wrong bulb. I was very disappointed that I couldn't return the item for exchange without paying a large amount of money. That's something I think may be helpful to change. But I was truly glad to find what I needed at your company"
"Alexis was extremely helpful and professional. She took her time to listen to my needs and sent price quotes promptly. Also. I needed help with tax exemption of which she was able to help. I received my globes in a very timely manner!!"
"Easy to find various options searching site for LED replacements for dual mini-flourescents with full specs listed, including base type, color (warmth), brightness (lumens), and interface (direct A/C and w/ballast and compatible with both).  Good price, and quick delivery.  Got exactly want I expected, site made it easy to reach and compare, and the LED replacement bulbs fit & works perfectly."
"Shipped in time but unfortunately my bulbs was damaged during transport but Kristin and Pam reacted super fast on my claim and send replacements! "
"For difficult to find bulbs especially LED replacements, 1000bulbs is the best. Their online interface is easy to use and fast. Shipping is expensive but fair and quick. All around good experience."
"As a contractor, I can say this is not the best place to go. I've done some level of business with 1000bulbs.com for years now. Our last project that we used 100 bulbs as a vendor will be our last purchase. Fixtures and lamps from same manufacturer at same color were not the same color lamps. We tried different products from 1000bulbs but were not able to get a color match. Had to go to one of our regular wholesalers before we could get the situation resolved. Lots of wasted time, jobsite labor and money with minimal help or real concern from the 1000bulb staff."
"Great prices, expansive selection, excellent service, and packing/delivery is exceptional!  Been using 1000Bulbs for years!"
"Outstanding Custer service.  It’s always a pleasure doing business with a team of experts.  When you get a great company like this and the “same” advisor that knows you by name, you have a known quantity that understands you and your needs!  Great customer service and Connor is out representing the company and its values.  Bob Effler"

"Alexis was extremely helpful and professional. She took her time to listen to my needs and sent price quotes promptly. Also. I needed help with tax exemption of which she was able to help. I received my globes in a very timely manner!!"
"Easy to find various options searching site for LED replacements for dual mini-flourescents with full specs listed, including base type, color (warmth), brightness (lumens), and interface (direct A/C and w/ballast and compatible with both).  Good price, and quick delivery.  Got exactly want I expected, site made it easy to reach and compare, and the LED replacement bulbs fit & works perfectly."
"Shipped in time but unfortunately my bulbs was damaged during transport but Kristin and Pam reacted super fast on my claim and send replacements! "
"For difficult to find bulbs especially LED replacements, 1000bulbs is the best. Their online interface is easy to use and fast. Shipping is expensive but fair and quick. All around good experience."
"As a contractor, I can say this is not the best place to go. I've done some level of business with 1000bulbs.com for years now. Our last project that we used 100 bulbs as a vendor will be our last purchase. Fixtures and lamps from same manufacturer at same color were not the same color lamps. We tried different products from 1000bulbs but were not able to get a color match. Had to go to one of our regular wholesalers before we could get the situation resolved. Lots of wasted time, jobsite labor and money with minimal help or real concern from the 1000bulb staff."
"Great prices, expansive selection, excellent service, and packing/delivery is exceptional!  Been using 1000Bulbs for years!"
"Outstanding Custer service.  It’s always a pleasure doing business with a team of experts.  When you get a great company like this and the “same” advisor that knows you by name, you have a known quantity that understands you and your needs!  Great customer service and Connor is out representing the company and its values.  Bob Effler"
"I have ordered from 1000Bulbs.com before and that is why I returned for a new set of specialty bulbs for some new fixtures I installed in my kitchen. The bulbs arrived very well packaged and all were functional."
"The salesman, Chad Pederson, the quality and ease of installment."
"Good price, product was exactly what I needed. Hard to find 5000k bulbs some times. Wish there were less expensive shipping option."
"I had a concern and they were immediately on top of it.It ended up being very minor (thank goodness). But they rectified it even though I told them it was not necessary. I will continue to use them for our light bulb needs."
"I bought their recommended 8' LED florescent replacement lamps for a commercial coffee roaster customer. These are for the ceiling fixtures in their warehouse.Using the lamp manufacturer's life rating, in this application (on 10 hours a day) they should have lasted 20 years. The first one failed after 3 months, now 2 more... so one by one they are failing and rather then sending out a better quality replacement at their cost, they are issuing pro-rated credits (sigh).To me this means they do not test the lamps or source high quality products, so beware that failure might be a common experience. Also, prorating the credits is sleezy and means they do not stand behind the items they recommend.Will I buy from them again? Nope!"
"I was struggling to find purple candlestick bulbs that actually glowed purple. I ordered and returned other brands several times because they looked pink or red when plugged in. The online rep shared a link to the comments about these lights (positive reviews for purple color) so I gave them a shot. I was not disappointed! They glow a nice true purple. Thanks for the help!"
"They helped me find exactly what I needed and had been looking in dozens of stores for. Best part is it all worked exactly as offered. "
"Easy ordering good product, price and delivery."
"Extremely happy with their customer service and their pricing.Have an account with them that was set up by a different person that is no longer with my organization (didn't know the sign in username or password). I spoke with the Commercial Account Manager and he changed the login information for me and took my order. After I gave him my order, he asked if there was anything else I needed or wanted. After I told him no, he explained to me their minimum order amount and free shipping. I ended up with an extra light fixture and a case of LED bulbs for less than my original order amount."
"Products arrived as commited, were well-packed and met expectations."
"The delivery was great, ordered it on Wednesday and got it on Saturday, over Thanksgiving, could not believe it. The quality of the products are excellent. Just finished installing all the lights and everything worked out perfectly. If and when I need more lighting equipment I will definitely purchase it from this company. Thanks"
"Customer service was helpful prior to ordering the LED Customer service was helpful prior to ordering the LED Christmas lights (pure white).  Order came quickly and the lights are perfect.  First, they do not flicker, just as the phone rep had assured me. Second, they are very bright, so much so that I bought a dimmer and the lights work perfectly with dimmer.  Only negative is price, but these kind of flicker-free LED light are expensive everywhere."
"I found regular A19 incandescent bulbs at 1000bulbs.com. My intention was to buy 3 dozen bulbs. The product says \"$3.84 each.\" And just to the left in the description, it says \"12 per case.\" So I started the order. When they wanted to charge me over $14 for shipping I decided it was worth it to pay this shipping rate for 36 bulbs since the product price was so good. $28 total. HOWEVER, I received 3 bulbs in an 8x8x8 box with foam peanuts. When I called to explain and complain, they said it's made clear further down in the description. I asked for a return shipping label to return the product. They said OK. The next day I receive an email with a return address and an explanation they don't pay for return shipping and that it might not be worth returning the bulbs. Wow! I emailed back to explain that they were using deceptive marketing practices and to please pay for return shipping and refund the returned product. No communication after that. I'm guessing they know people will get confused and depend on them not wanting to pay for return shipping. What a racket!  UPDATE: Once they saw my complaint, 1000bulbs immediately sent me a refund for the product, but not the shipping (which cost more than the product). They didn't respond to a request for shipping reimbursement."
"Ordered 3 light bulbs which were delivered within a few days. When I thought it was really great was that these bulbs were packed very securely a box that was a decent size and packed very carefully with Styrofoam peanuts. The box was secure, and I was very happy that they took extra care in packaging the lightbulbs to prevent breakage. I will order again from them because I feel very confident in their product and they’re shipping"
"Before contacting 1000 Bulbs, I had tried multiple other sites and an unsuccessful trip to a big box store to find LED replacement bulbs that fit our fixture. The chat operator responded immediately to my inquiry and located two options. The order arrived very quickly and the bulbs were exactly what I needed."
"The person who answered the phone was absolutelygreat because she was patient, smart, and when she could not find an item I requested she found another source for me to go to.That's Awesome!Thank you 1000bulbs!James Truesdale"
"Crystal at 1000Bulbs communicated clearly and promptly with me so I knew what was happening with my special order, when to expect it, and also answered the phone within 2 rings-so nice not to get an automated answering machine with many questions!  I actually received my order more quickly than expected.  Definitely I will call them if I have any more electrical needs!  Very nice company!"
"1000Bulbs had the exact replacement sockets I needed to rebuild a heat lamp for my restaurant. Easy ordering, fast shipping.."
"You are an extremely efficient and superior company to do business with, from start to finish. Placing the Oder is easy, no hassle. Shipping is quick. And your packaging to keep the bulbs safe from damage is impeccable!  I have ordered from you before and was super pleased. That’s why I came back!!"
"1000Bulbs kicks ass! I got 25% off, received my order in 3 business days, and when I called for advice spoke to customer service immediately and had all my questions answered. I bought a socket spool and C7 lights for my house and it looks amazing."
"The best customer service - multiple names and numbers provided.Received order in less than four days.All bulbs lite up.Two hundred bulbs installed in less than five hours.Order Confirmation form is the best layout I have seen."
"Michael Said is a super technical adviser who helps our church on light bulbs selection. It is rare to have such a nice, knowledgeable person to help us when we need it."
"I've ordered from 1000 bulbs a few times before and always got what I wanted.  I'm reviewing them today after they DIDN'T have what I wanted.  I needed a specific kind of mini candelabra base with a \"cool\" (whiter) light.  A rep tried to find what I needed.  They didn't have it, but they referred me to a specific competitor who did have it.  THAT is customer service!"
"These guys always have the best prices on their lighting and are always helpful with our needs. They ship really quick, too.  The lights got here on Monday and were just ordered the Thursday before.  Thank you."
"Alexis Dominguez Was more than helpful. She had no issues dealing with the many changes we had and was always pleasant. Very knowledgeable and quick to respond!"
"I’ve had a difficult time finding clear bulbs for my bathroom heat lamp. They had exactly what I needed!  My order shipped quickly and was carefully packed to ensure the fragile bulbs arrived safely."
"My first time making a purchase with this company. Jordyn in customer service was very helpful with my order."
"I just received the sockets moments ago... They are of excellent quality. I would only suggest that you find a lower shipping cost. The items were overly packaged, and could easily have fit in a padded envelope."
"Finally the Christmas lights my wife has always wantedMy wife and I have been wanting to have a nice set of warm white lights lining the edge of our roof for years, I even built the house with outlets positioned to make it as clean and easy as possible, but I could never find a good dealer for high quality commercial grade cords and lights that I could customize to exact lengths, but now I have and we couldn’t be happier!!"
"The bulbs arrived in 2 days, they work beautifully, & you packed the shipment so carefully, your price was the best I've found; I bought the color changing led c9 bulbs"
"I've always had good experiences shopping here.  The prices are great and the selection is even better.  The filter tools are also well thought out to get you exactly what you're looking for."
"Order placed easy. Delivery was fast and in good condition. I made the mistake of ordering the wrong bulb.

"I ordered a case of T8 flourescent bulbs from them.  The box was not marked fragile, glass, or in anyway to indicate the contents. FedEx delivered and proceeded to throw the box 2+ feet onto my concrete porch.  I immediately contacted them asking for some compensation (reduction on the order). Nope, I have 1 week to inspect each bulb in the case (i.e. individually test each bulb in a fixture to make sure it works) and then re-contact them to reconcille the issue.  I have shared with them the Ring Doorbell video of the driver throwing the box but 1000Bulbs does not care.  Leaving tomorrow for an extended international business trip so the 1 week period to assess damages is just not possible.   "

"As a contractor, I can say this is not the best place to go. I've done some level of business with 1000bulbs.com for years now. Our last project that we used 100 bulbs as a vendor will be our last purchase. Fixtures and lamps from same manufacturer at same color were not the same color lamps. We tried different products from 1000bulbs but were not able to get a color match. Had to go to one of our regular wholesalers before we could get the situation resolved. Lots of wasted time, jobsite labor and money with minimal help or real concern from the 1000bulb staff."
"Great prices, expansive selection, excellent service, and packing/delivery is exceptional!  Been using 1000Bulbs for years!"
"Outstanding Custer service.  It’s always a pleasure doing business with a team of experts.  When you get a great company like this and the “same” advisor that knows you by name, you have a known quantity that understands you and your needs!  Great customer service and Connor is out representing the company and its values.  Bob Effler"
"I have ordered from 1000Bulbs.com before and that is why I returned for a new set of specialty bulbs for some new fixtures I installed in my kitchen. The bulbs arrived very well packaged and all were functional."
"The salesman, Chad Pederson, the quality and ease of installment."
"Good price, product was exactly what I needed. Hard to find 5000k bulbs some times. Wish there were less expensive shipping option."
"I had a concern and they were immediately on top of it.It ended up being very minor (thank goodness). But they rectified it even though I told them it was not necessary. I will continue to use them for our light bulb needs."
"I bought their recommended 8' LED florescent replacement lamps for a commercial coffee roaster customer. These are for the ceiling fixtures in their warehouse.Using the lamp manufacturer's life rating, in this application (on 10 hours a day) they should have lasted 20 years. The first one failed after 3 months, now 2 more... so one by one they are failing and rather then sending out a better quality replacement at their cost, they are issuing pro-rated credits (sigh).To me this means they do not test the lamps or source high quality products, so beware that failure might be a common experience. Also, prorating the credits is sleezy and means they do not stand behind the items they recommend.Will I buy from them again? Nope!"
"I was struggling to find purple candlestick bulbs that actually glowed purple. I ordered and returned other brands several times because they looked pink or red when plugged in. The online rep shared a link to the comments about these lights (positive reviews for purple color) so I gave them a shot. I was not disappointed! They glow a nice true purple. Thanks for the help!"
"They helped me find exactly what I needed and had been looking in dozens of stores for. Best part is it all worked exactly as offered. "
"Easy ordering good product, price and delivery."
"Extremely happy with their customer service and their pricing.Have an account with them that was set up by a different person that is no longer with my organization (didn't know the sign in username or password). I spoke with the Commercial Account Manager and he changed the login information for me and took my order. After I gave him my order, he asked if there was anything else I needed or wanted. After I told him no, he explained to me their minimum order amount and free shipping. I ended up with an extra light fixture and a case of LED bulbs for less than my original order amount."
"Products arrived as commited, were well-packed and met expectations."
"The delivery was great, ordered it on Wednesday and got it on Saturday, over Thanksgiving, could not believe it. The quality of the products are excellent. Just finished installing all the lights and everything worked out perfectly. If and when I need more lighting equipment I will definitely purchase it from this company. Thanks"
"Customer service was helpful prior to ordering the LED Customer service was helpful prior to ordering the LED Christmas lights (pure white).  Order came quickly and the lights are perfect.  First, they do not flicker, just as the phone rep had assured me. Second, they are very bright, so much so that I bought a dimmer and the lights work perfectly with dimmer.  Only negative is price, but these kind of flicker-free LED light are expensive everywhere."

"I found regular A19 incandescent bulbs at 1000bulbs.com. My intention was to buy 3 dozen bulbs. The product says \"$3.84 each.\" And just to the left in the description, it says \"12 per case.\" So I started the order. When they wanted to charge me over $14 for shipping I decided it was worth it to pay this shipping rate for 36 bulbs since the product price was so good. $28 total. HOWEVER, I received 3 bulbs in an 8x8x8 box with foam peanuts. When I called to explain and complain, they said it's made clear further down in the description. I asked for a return shipping label to return the product. They said OK. The next day I receive an email with a return address and an explanation they don't pay for return shipping and that it might not be worth returning the bulbs. Wow! I emailed back to explain that they were using deceptive marketing practices and to please pay for return shipping and refund the returned product. No communication after that. I'm guessing they know people will get confused and depend on them not wanting to pay for return shipping. What a racket!  UPDATE: Once they saw my complaint, 1000bulbs immediately sent me a refund for the product, but not the shipping (which cost more than the product). They didn't respond to a request for shipping reimbursement."
"Ordered 3 light bulbs which were delivered within a few days. When I thought it was really great was that these bulbs were packed very securely a box that was a decent size and packed very carefully with Styrofoam peanuts. The box was secure, and I was very happy that they took extra care in packaging the lightbulbs to prevent breakage. I will order again from them because I feel very confident in their product and they’re shipping"
"Before contacting 1000 Bulbs, I had tried multiple other sites and an unsuccessful trip to a big box store to find LED replacement bulbs that fit our fixture. The chat operator responded immediately to my inquiry and located two options. The order arrived very quickly and the bulbs were exactly what I needed."
"The person who answered the phone was absolutelygreat because she was patient, smart, and when she could not find an item I requested she found another source for me to go to.That's Awesome!Thank you 1000bulbs!James Truesdale"
"Crystal at 1000Bulbs communicated clearly and promptly with me so I knew what was happening with my special order, when to expect it, and also answered the phone within 2 rings-so nice not to get an automated answering machine with many questions!  I actually received my order more quickly than expected.  Definitely I will call them if I have any more electrical needs!  Very nice company!"
"1000Bulbs had the exact replacement sockets I needed to rebuild a heat lamp for my restaurant. Easy ordering, fast shipping.."
"You are an extremely efficient and superior company to do business with, from start to finish. Placing the Oder is easy, no hassle. Shipping is quick. And your packaging to keep the bulbs safe from damage is impeccable!  I have ordered from you before and was super pleased. That’s why I came back!!"
"1000Bulbs kicks ass! I got 25% off, received my order in 3 business days, and when I called for advice spoke to customer service immediately and had all my questions answered. I bought a socket spool and C7 lights for my house and it looks amazing."
"The best customer service - multiple names and numbers provided.Received order in less than four days.All bulbs lite up.Two hundred bulbs installed in less than five hours.Order Confirmation form is the best layout I have seen."
"Michael Said is a super technical adviser who helps our church on light bulbs selection. It is rare to have such a nice, knowledgeable person to help us when we need it."
"I've ordered from 1000 bulbs a few times before and always got what I wanted.  I'm reviewing them today after they DIDN'T have what I wanted.  I needed a specific kind of mini candelabra base with a \"cool\" (whiter) light.  A rep tried to find what I needed.  They didn't have it, but they referred me to a specific competitor who did have it.  THAT is customer service!"
"These guys always have the best prices on their lighting and are always helpful with our needs. They ship really quick, too.  The lights got here on Monday and were just ordered the Thursday before.  Thank you."
"Alexis Dominguez Was more than helpful. She had no issues dealing with the many changes we had and was always pleasant. Very knowledgeable and quick to respond!"
"I’ve had a difficult time finding clear bulbs for my bathroom heat lamp. They had exactly what I needed!  My order shipped quickly and was carefully packed to ensure the fragile bulbs arrived safely."
"My first time making a purchase with this company. Jordyn in customer service was very helpful with my order."
"I just received the sockets moments ago... They are of excellent quality. I would only suggest that you find a lower shipping cost. The items were overly packaged, and could easily have fit in a padded envelope."
"Finally the Christmas lights my wife has always wantedMy wife and I have been wanting to have a nice set of warm white lights lining the edge of our roof for years, I even built the house with outlets positioned to make it as clean and easy as possible, but I could never find a good dealer for high quality commercial grade cords and lights that I could customize to exact lengths, but now I have and we couldn’t be happier!!"
"The bulbs arrived in 2 days, they work beautifully, & you packed the shipment so carefully, your price was the best I've found; I bought the color changing led c9 bulbs"
"I've always had good experiences shopping here.  The prices are great and the selection is even better.  The filter tools are also well thought out to get you exactly what you're looking for."
"Order placed easy. Delivery was fast and in good condition. I made the mistake of ordering the wrong bulb.

"Crystal at 1000Bulbs communicated clearly and promptly with me so I knew what was happening with my special order, when to expect it, and also answered the phone within 2 rings-so nice not to get an automated answering machine with many questions!

"I've ordered from 1000 bulbs a few times before and always got what I wanted.  I'm reviewing them today after they DIDN'T have what I wanted.  I needed a specific kind of mini candelabra base with a \"cool\" (whiter) light.  A rep tried to find what I needed.  They didn't have it, but they referred me to a specific competitor who did have it.  THAT is customer service!"
"These guys always have the best prices on their lighting and are always helpful with our needs. They ship really quick, too.  The lights got here on Monday and were just ordered the Thursday before.  Thank you."

"My first time making a purchase with this company. Jordyn in customer service was very helpful with my order."
"I just received the sockets moments ago... They are of excellent quality. I would only suggest that you find a lower shipping cost. The items were overly packaged, and could easily have fit in a padded envelope."
"Finally the Christmas lights my wife has always wantedMy wife and I have been wanting to have a nice set of warm white lights lining the edge of our roof for years, I even built the house with outlets positioned to make it as clean and easy as possible, but I could never find a good dealer for high quality commercial grade cords and lights that I could customize to exact lengths, but now I have and we couldn’t be happier!!"
"The bulbs arrived in 2 days, they work beautifully, & you packed the shipment so carefully, your price was the best I've found; I bought the color changing led c9 bulbs"
"I've always had good experiences shopping here.  The prices are great and the selection is even better.  The filter tools are also well thought out to get you exactly what you're looking for."

"Ease of use for web-based shopping and online customer support via chat."
"It has been a while since I placed an order. Was happy to find an email response to order with reference/contact info of my customer service rep. It came in handy when one of the bulbs arrived damaged. I sent a picture to rep and they got a replacement out right away! Thank you!"

"I put the 150 foot rope lights throughout the yard, suspended to stainless steel cables, fastened every 12 inches and they came out great!"
"I have been a repeat customer for years.  Great products, always a good selection, items are well packed and delivered quickly.  I will always look to 1000Bulbs for my lighting needs!"

"Easy to find various options searching site for LED replacements for dual mini-flourescents with full specs listed, including base type, color (warmth), brightness (lumens), and interface (direct A/C and w/ballast and compatible with both).  Good price, and quick delivery.  Got exactly want I expected, site made it easy to reach and compare, and the LED replacement bulbs fit & works perfectly."

"For difficult to find bulbs especially LED replacements, 1000bulbs is the best. Their online interface is easy to use and fast. Shipping is expensive but fair and quick. All around good experience."
"As a contractor, I can say this is not the best place to go. I've done some level of business with 1000bulbs.com for years now. Our last project that we used 100 bulbs as a vendor will be our last purchase. Fixtures and lamps from same manufacturer at same color were not the same color lamps. We tried different products from 1000bulbs but were not able to get a color match. Had to go to one of our regular wholesalers before we could get the situation resolved. Lots of wasted time, jobsite labor and money with minimal help or real concern from the 1000bulb staff."
"Great prices, expansive selection, excellent service, and packing/delivery is exceptional!  Been using 1000Bulbs for years!"
"Outstanding Custer service.  It’s always a pleasure doing business with a team of experts.  When you get a great company like this and the “same” advisor that knows you by name, you have a known quantity that understands you and your needs!  Great customer service and Connor is out representing the company and its values.  Bob Effler"
"I have ordered from 1000Bulbs.com before and that is why I returned for a new set of specialty bulbs for some new fixtures I installed in my kitchen. The bulbs arrived very well packaged and all were functional."
"The salesman, Chad Pederson, the quality and ease of installment."
"Good price, product was exactly what I needed. Hard to find 5000k bulbs some times. Wish there were less expensive shipping option."
"I had a concern and they were immediately on top of it.It ended up being very minor (thank goodness). But they rectified it even though I told them it was not necessary. I will continue to use them for our light bulb needs."
"I bought their recommended 8' LED florescent replacement lamps for a commercial coffee roaster customer. These are for the ceiling fixtures in their warehouse.Using the lamp manufacturer's life rating, in this application (on 10 hours a day) they should have lasted 20 years. The first one failed after 3 months, now 2 more... so one by one they are failing and rather then sending out a better quality replacement at their cost, they are issuing pro-rated credits (sigh).To me this means they do not test the lamps or source high quality products, so beware that failure might be a common experience. Also, prorating the credits is sleezy and means they do not stand behind the items they recommend.Will I buy from them again? Nope!"
"I was struggling to find purple candlestick bulbs that actually glowed purple. I ordered and returned other brands several times because they looked pink or red when plugged in. The online rep shared a link to the comments about these lights (positive reviews for purple color) so I gave them a shot. I was not disappointed! They glow a nice true purple. Thanks for the help!"
"They helped me find exactly what I needed and had been looking in dozens of stores for. Best part is it all worked exactly as offered. "
"Easy ordering good product, price and delivery."
"Extremely happy with their customer service and their pricing.Have an account with them that was set up by a different person that is no longer with my organization (didn't know the sign in username or password). I spoke with the Commercial Account Manager and he changed the login information for me and took my order. After I gave him my order, he asked if there was anything else I needed or wanted. After I told him no, he explained to me their minimum order amount and free shipping. I ended up with an extra light fixture and a case of LED bulbs for less than my original order amount."
"Products arrived as commited, were well-packed and met expectations."
"The delivery was great, ordered it on Wednesday and got it on Saturday, over Thanksgiving, could not believe it. The quality of the products are excellent. Just finished installing all the lights and everything worked out perfectly. If and when I need more lighting equipment I will definitely purchase it from this company. Thanks"
"Customer service was helpful prior to ordering the LED Customer service was helpful prior to ordering the LED Christmas lights (pure white).  Order came quickly and the lights are perfect.  First, they do not flicker, just as the phone rep had assured me. Second, they are very bright, so much so that I bought a dimmer and the lights work perfectly with dimmer.  Only negative is price, but these kind of flicker-free LED light are expensive everywhere."

"I found regular A19 incandescent bulbs at 1000bulbs.com. My intention was to buy 3 dozen bulbs. The product says \"$3.84 each.\" And just to the left in the description, it says \"12 per case.\" So I started the order. When they wanted to charge me over $14 for shipping I decided it was worth it to pay this shipping rate for 36 bulbs since the product price was so good. $28 total. HOWEVER, I received 3 bulbs in an 8x8x8 box with foam peanuts. When I called to explain and complain, they said it's made clear further down in the description. I asked for a return shipping label to return the product. They said OK. The next day I receive an email with a return address and an explanation they don't pay for return shipping and that it might not be worth returning the bulbs. Wow! I emailed back to explain that they were using deceptive marketing practices and to please pay for return shipping and refund the returned product. No communication after that. I'm guessing they know people will get confused and depend on them not wanting to pay for return shipping. What a racket!  UPDATE: Once they saw my complaint, 1000bulbs immediately sent me a refund for the product, but not the shipping (which cost more than the product). They didn't respond to a request for shipping reimbursement."
"Ordered 3 light bulbs which were delivered within a few days. When I thought it was really great was that these bulbs were packed very securely a box that was a decent size and packed very carefully with Styrofoam peanuts. The box was secure, and I was very happy that they took extra care in packaging the lightbulbs to prevent breakage. I will order again from them because I feel very confident in their product and they’re shipping"
"Before contacting 1000 Bulbs, I had tried multiple other sites and an unsuccessful trip to a big box store to find LED replacement bulbs that fit our fixture. The chat operator responded immediately to my inquiry and located two options. The order arrived very quickly and the bulbs were exactly what I needed."
"The person who answered the phone was absolutelygreat because she was patient, smart, and when she could not find an item I requested she found another source for me to go to.That's Awesome!Thank you 1000bulbs!James Truesdale"

"Customer service was helpful prior to ordering the LED Customer service was helpful prior to ordering the LED Christmas lights (pure white).  Order came quickly and the lights are perfect.  First, they do not flicker, just as the phone rep had assured me. Second, they are very bright, so much so that I bought a dimmer and the lights work perfectly with dimmer.  Only negative is price, but these kind of flicker-free LED light are expensive everywhere."
"I found regular A19 incandescent bulbs at 1000bulbs.com. My intention was to buy 3 dozen bulbs. The product says \"$3.84 each.\" And just to the left in the description, it says \"12 per case.\" So I started the order. When they wanted to charge me over $14 for shipping I decided it was worth it to pay this shipping rate for 36 bulbs since the product price was so good. $28 total. HOWEVER, I received 3 bulbs in an 8x8x8 box with foam peanuts. When I called to explain and complain, they said it's made clear further down in the description. I asked for a return shipping label to return the product. They said OK. The next day I receive an email with a return address and an explanation they don't pay for return shipping and that it might not be worth returning the bulbs. Wow! I emailed back to explain that they were using deceptive marketing practices and to please pay for return shipping and refund the returned product. No communication after that. I'm guessing they know people will get confused and depend on them not wanting to pay for return shipping. What a racket!  UPDATE: Once they saw my complaint, 1000bulbs immediately sent me a refund for the product, but not the shipping (which cost more than the product). They didn't respond to a request for shipping reimbursement."
"Ordered 3 light bulbs which were delivered within a few days. When I thought it was really great was that these bulbs were packed very securely a box that was a decent size and packed very carefully with Styrofoam peanuts. The box was secure, and I was very happy that they took extra care in packaging the lightbulbs to prevent breakage. I will order again from them because I feel very confident in their product and they’re shipping"
"Before contacting 1000 Bulbs, I had tried multiple other sites and an unsuccessful trip to a big box store to find LED replacement bulbs that fit our fixture. The chat operator responded immediately to my inquiry and located two options. The order arrived very quickly and the bulbs were exactly what I needed."

"As a contractor, I can say this is not the best place to go. I've done some level of business with 1000bulbs.com for years now. Our last project that we used 100 bulbs as a vendor will be our last purchase. Fixtures and lamps from same manufacturer at same color were not the same color lamps. We tried different products from 1000bulbs but were not able to get a color match. Had to go to one of our regular wholesalers before we could get the situation resolved. Lots of wasted time, jobsite labor and money with minimal help or real concern from the 1000bulb staff."

"I had a concern and they were immediately on top of it.It ended up being very minor (thank goodness). But they rectified it even though I told them it was not necessary. I will continue to use them for our light bulb needs."
"I bought their recommended 8' LED florescent replacement lamps for a commercial coffee roaster customer. These are for the ceiling fixtures in their warehouse.Using the lamp manufacturer's life rating, in this application (on 10 hours a day) they should have lasted 20 years. The first one failed after 3 months, now 2 more... so one by one they are failing and rather then sending out a better quality replacement at their cost, they are issuing pro-rated credits (sigh).To me this means they do not test the lamps or source high quality products, so beware that failure might be a common experience. Also, prorating the credits is sleezy and means they do not stand behind the items they recommend.Will I buy from them again? Nope!"
"I was struggling to find purple candlestick bulbs that actually glowed purple. I ordered and returned other brands several times because they looked pink or red when plugged in. The online rep shared a link to the comments about these lights (positive reviews for purple color) so I gave them a shot. I was not disappointed! They glow a nice true purple. Thanks for the help!"
"They helped me find exactly what I needed and had been looking in dozens of stores for. Best part is it all worked exactly as offered. "
"Easy ordering good product, price and delivery."
"Extremely happy with their customer service and their pricing.Have an account with them that was set up by a different person that is no longer with my organization (didn't know the sign in username or password). I spoke with the Commercial Account Manager and he changed the login information for me and took my order. After I gave him my order, he asked if there was anything else I needed or wanted. After I told him no, he explained to me their minimum order amount and free shipping. I ended up with an extra light fixture and a case of LED bulbs for less than my original order amount."
"Products arrived as commited, were well-packed and met expectations."
"The delivery was great, ordered it on Wednesday and got it on Saturday, over Thanksgiving, could not believe it. The quality of the products are excellent.

Only negative is price, but these kind of flicker-free LED light are expensive everywhere."
"Order placed easy. Delivery was fast and in good condition. I made the mistake of ordering the wrong bulb. I was very disappointed that I couldn't return the item for exchange without paying a large amount of money. That's something I think may be helpful to change. But I was truly glad to find what I needed at your company"
"Alexis was extremely helpful and professional. She took her time to listen to my needs and sent price quotes promptly. Also. I needed help with tax exemption of which she was able to help. I received my globes in a very timely manner!!"
"Easy to find various options searching site for LED replacements for dual mini-flourescents with full specs listed, including base type, color (warmth), brightness (lumens), and interface (direct A/C and w/ballast and compatible with both).  Good price, and quick delivery.  Got exactly want I expected, site made it easy to reach and compare, and the LED replacement bulbs fit & works perfectly."
"Shipped in time but unfortunately my bulbs was damaged during transport but Kristin and Pam reacted super fast on my claim and send replacements! "
"For difficult to find bulbs especially LED replacements, 1000bulbs is the best. Their online interface is easy to use and fast. Shipping is expensive but fair and quick. All around good experience."
"As a contractor, I can say this is not the best place to go. I've done some level of business with 1000bulbs.com for years now. Our last project that we used 100 bulbs as a vendor will be our last purchase. Fixtures and lamps from same manufacturer at same color were not the same color lamps. We tried different products from 1000bulbs but were not able to get a color match. Had to go to one of our regular wholesalers before we could get the situation resolved. Lots of wasted time, jobsite labor and money with minimal help or real concern from the 1000bulb staff."
"Great prices, expansive selection, excellent service, and packing/delivery is exceptional!  Been using 1000Bulbs for years!"
"Outstanding Custer service.  It’s always a pleasure doing business with a team of experts.  When you get a great company like this and the “same” advisor that knows you by name, you have a known quantity that understands you and your needs!  Great customer service and Connor is out representing the company and its values.  Bob Effler"
"I have ordered from 1000Bulbs.com before and that is why I returned for a new set of specialty bulbs for some new fixtures I installed in my kitchen. The bulbs arrived very well packaged and all were functional."
"The salesman, Chad Pederson, the quality and ease of installment."
"Good price, product was exactly what I needed. Hard to find 5000k bulbs some times. Wish there were less expensive shipping option."
"I had a concern and they were immediately on top of it.It ended up being very minor (thank goodness). But they rectified it even though I told them it was not necessary. I will continue to use them for our light bulb needs."
"I bought their recommended 8' LED florescent replacement lamps for a commercial coffee roaster customer. These are for the ceiling fixtures in their warehouse.Using the lamp manufacturer's life rating, in this application (on 10 hours a day) they should have lasted 20 years. The first one failed after 3 months, now 2 more... so one by one they are failing and rather then sending out a better quality replacement at their cost, they are issuing pro-rated credits (sigh).To me this means they do not test the lamps or source high quality products, so beware that failure might be a common experience. Also, prorating the credits is sleezy and means they do not stand behind the items they recommend.Will I buy from them again? Nope!"
"I was struggling to find purple candlestick bulbs that actually glowed purple. I ordered and returned other brands several times because they looked pink or red when plugged in. The online rep shared a link to the comments about these lights (positive reviews for purple color) so I gave them a shot. I was not disappointed! They glow a nice true purple. Thanks for the help!"
"They helped me find exactly what I needed and had been looking in dozens of stores for. Best part is it all worked exactly as offered. "
"Easy ordering good product, price and delivery."
"Extremely happy with their customer service and their pricing.Have an account with them that was set up by a different person that is no longer with my organization (didn't know the sign in username or password). I spoke with the Commercial Account Manager and he changed the login information for me and took my order. After I gave him my order, he asked if there was anything else I needed or wanted. After I told him no, he explained to me their minimum order amount and free shipping. I ended up with an extra light fixture and a case of LED bulbs for less than my original order amount."
"Products arrived as commited, were well-packed and met expectations."
"The delivery was great, ordered it on Wednesday and got it on Saturday, over Thanksgiving, could not believe it. The quality of the products are excellent. Just finished installing all the lights and everything worked out perfectly. If and when I need more lighting equipment I will definitely purchase it from this company. Thanks"

"I found regular A19 incandescent bulbs at 1000bulbs.com. My intention was to buy 3 dozen bulbs. The product says \"$3.84 each.\" And just to the left in the description, it says \"12 per case.\" So I started the order. When they wanted to charge me over $14 for shipping I decided it was worth it to pay this shipping rate for 36 bulbs since the product price was so good. $28 total. HOWEVER, I received 3 bulbs in an 8x8x8 box with foam peanuts. When I called to explain and complain, they said it's made clear further down in the description. I asked for a return shipping label to return the product. They said OK. The next day I receive an email with a return address and an explanation they don't pay for return shipping and that it might not be worth returning the bulbs. Wow! I emailed back to explain that they were using deceptive marketing practices and to please pay for return shipping and refund the returned product. No communication after that. I'm guessing they know people will get confused and depend on them not wanting to pay for return shipping. What a racket!  UPDATE: Once they saw my complaint, 1000bulbs immediately sent me a refund for the product, but not the shipping (which cost more than the product). They didn't respond to a request for shipping reimbursement."
"Ordered 3 light bulbs which were delivered within a few days. When I thought it was really great was that these bulbs were packed very securely a box that was a decent size and packed very carefully with Styrofoam peanuts. The box was secure, and I was very happy that they took extra care in packaging the lightbulbs to prevent breakage. I will order again from them because I feel very confident in their product and they’re shipping"
"Before contacting 1000 Bulbs, I had tried multiple other sites and an unsuccessful trip to a big box store to find LED replacement bulbs that fit our fixture. The chat operator responded immediately to my inquiry and located two options. The order arrived very quickly and the bulbs were exactly what I needed."
"The person who answered the phone was absolutelygreat because she was patient, smart, and when she could not find an item I requested she found another source for me to go to.That's Awesome!Thank you 1000bulbs!James Truesdale"
"Crystal at 1000Bulbs communicated clearly and promptly with me so I knew what was happening with my special order, when to expect it, and also answered the phone within 2 rings-so nice not to get an automated answering machine with many questions!  I actually received my order more quickly than expected.  Definitely I will call them if I have any more electrical needs!  Very nice company!"
"1000Bulbs had the exact replacement sockets I needed to rebuild a heat lamp for my restaurant. Easy ordering, fast shipping.."
"You are an extremely efficient and superior company to do business with, from start to finish. Placing the Oder is easy, no hassle. Shipping is quick. And your packaging to keep the bulbs safe from damage is impeccable!  I have ordered from you before and was super pleased. That’s why I came back!!"
"1000Bulbs kicks ass! I got 25% off, received my order in 3 business days, and when I called for advice spoke to customer service immediately and had all my questions answered. I bought a socket spool and C7 lights for my house and it looks amazing."
"The best customer service - multiple names and numbers provided.Received order in less than four days.All bulbs lite up.Two hundred bulbs installed in less than five hours.Order Confirmation form is the best layout I have seen."
"Michael Said is a super technical adviser who helps our church on light bulbs selection. It is rare to have such a nice, knowledgeable person to help us when we need it."
"I've ordered from 1000 bulbs a few times before and always got what I wanted.  I'm reviewing them today after they DIDN'T have what I wanted.  I needed a specific kind of mini candelabra base with a \"cool\" (whiter) light.  A rep tried to find what I needed.  They didn't have it, but they referred me to a specific competitor who did have it.  THAT is customer service!"
"These guys always have the best prices on their lighting and are always helpful with our needs. They ship really quick, too.  The lights got here on Monday and were just ordered the Thursday before.  Thank you."
"Alexis Dominguez Was more than helpful. She had no issues dealing with the many changes we had and was always pleasant. Very knowledgeable and quick to respond!"
"I’ve had a difficult time finding clear bulbs for my bathroom heat lamp. They had exactly what I needed!  My order shipped quickly and was carefully packed to ensure the fragile bulbs arrived safely."
"My first time making a purchase with this company. Jordyn in customer service was very helpful with my order."
"I just received the sockets moments ago... They are of excellent quality. I would only suggest that you find a lower shipping cost. The items were overly packaged, and could easily have fit in a padded envelope."
"Finally the Christmas lights my wife has always wantedMy wife and I have been wanting to have a nice set of warm white lights lining the edge of our roof for years, I even built the house with outlets positioned to make it as clean and easy as possible, but I could never find a good dealer for high quality commercial grade cords and lights that I could customize to exact lengths, but now I have and we couldn’t be happier!!"
"The bulbs arrived in 2 days, they work beautifully, & you packed the shipment so carefully, your price was the best I've found; I bought the color changing led c9 bulbs"
"I've always had good experiences shopping here.  The prices are great and the selection is even better.  The filter tools are also well thought out to get you exactly what you're looking for."

"Ease of use for web-based shopping and online customer support via chat."
"It has been a while since I placed an order. Was happy to find an email response to order with reference/contact info of my customer service rep. It came in handy when one of the bulbs arrived damaged. I sent a picture to rep and they got a replacement out right away! Thank you!"
"Chad was extremely helpful finding us a new light bulb for our garage door openers since our last ones were banned from the US. Great customer service!!"
"They had less common bulb types that I needed from a name brand manufacturer and delivered in a short period of time."
"Easily found a repair part for a 40 year old microscope!Big thanks to customer service for quickly taking care of my tax exemption!"
"I was able to get all my questions answered by using the website. I purchased them at a better price than elsewhere, and my bulbs were shipped the next day. Now, shipping was a pain because it was FedEx only."
"I ordered a case of 40 46 inch flourecent bulbs arriving fast and best deal I could find. So far ist time buyer very pleased."
"1000Bulbs has been great to work with on every occasion.  After processing a replacement under warranty recently, I was impressed by the level of care, timeliness, and thoroughness they exhibited."
"I put the 150 foot rope lights throughout the yard, suspended to stainless steel cables, fastened every 12 inches and they came out great!"
"I have been a repeat customer for years.  Great products, always a good selection, items are well packed and delivered quickly.  I will always look to 1000Bulbs for my lighting needs!"

"I had a concern and they were immediately on top of it.It ended up being very minor (thank goodness). But they rectified it even though I told them it was not necessary. I will continue to use them for our light bulb needs."
"I bought their recommended 8' LED florescent replacement lamps for a commercial coffee roaster customer. These are for the ceiling fixtures in their warehouse.Using the lamp manufacturer's life rating, in this application (on 10 hours a day) they should have lasted 20 years. The first one failed after 3 months, now 2 more... so one by one they are failing and rather then sending out a better quality replacement at their cost, they are issuing pro-rated credits (sigh).To me this means they do not test the lamps or source high quality products, so beware that failure might be a common experience. Also, prorating the credits is sleezy and means they do not stand behind the items they recommend.Will I buy from them again? Nope!"
"I was struggling to find purple candlestick bulbs that actually glowed purple. I ordered and returned other brands several times because they looked pink or red when plugged in. The online rep shared a link to the comments about these lights (positive reviews for purple color) so I gave them a shot. I was not disappointed! They glow a nice true purple. Thanks for the help!"
"They helped me find exactly what I needed and had been looking in dozens of stores for. Best part is it all worked exactly as offered. "
"Easy ordering good product, price and delivery."
"Extremely happy with their customer service and their pricing.Have an account with them that was set up by a different person that is no longer with my organization (didn't know the sign in username or password). I spoke with the Commercial Account Manager and he changed the login information for me and took my order. After I gave him my order, he asked if there was anything else I needed or wanted. After I told him no, he explained to me their minimum order amount and free shipping. I ended up with an extra light fixture and a case of LED bulbs for less than my original order amount."
"Products arrived as commited, were well-packed and met expectations."
"The delivery was great, ordered it on Wednesday and got it on Saturday, over Thanksgiving, could not believe it. The quality of the products are excellent. Just finished installing all the lights and everything worked out perfectly. If and when I need more lighting equipment I will definitely purchase it from this company. Thanks"
"Customer service was helpful prior to ordering the LED Customer service was helpful prior to ordering the LED Christmas lights (pure white).  Order came quickly and the lights are perfect.  First, they do not flicker, just as the phone rep had assured me. Second, they are very bright, so much so that I bought a dimmer and the lights work perfectly with dimmer.  Only negative is price, but these kind of flicker-free LED light are expensive everywhere."
"Order placed easy. Delivery was fast and in good condition. I made the mistake of ordering the wrong bulb. I was very disappointed that I couldn't return the item for exchange without paying a large amount of money. That's something I think may be helpful to change. But I was truly glad to find what I needed at your company"
"Alexis was extremely helpful and professional. She took her time to listen to my needs and sent price quotes promptly. Also. I needed help with tax exemption of which she was able to help. I received my globes in a very timely manner!!"
"Easy to find various options searching site for LED replacements for dual mini-flourescents with full specs listed, including base type, color (warmth), brightness (lumens), and interface (direct A/C and w/ballast and compatible with both).  Good price, and quick delivery.  Got exactly want I expected, site made it easy to reach and compare, and the LED replacement bulbs fit & works perfectly."
"Shipped in time but unfortunately my bulbs was damaged during transport but Kristin and Pam reacted super fast on my claim and send replacements! "
"For difficult to find bulbs especially LED replacements, 1000bulbs is the best. Their online interface is easy to use and fast. Shipping is expensive but fair and quick. All around good experience."
"As a contractor, I can say this is not the best place to go. I've done some level of business with 1000bulbs.com for years now. Our last project that we used 100 bulbs as a vendor will be our last purchase. Fixtures and lamps from same manufacturer at same color were not the same color lamps. We tried different products from 1000bulbs but were not able to get a color match. Had to go to one of our regular wholesalers before we could get the situation resolved. Lots of wasted time, jobsite labor and money with minimal help or real concern from the 1000bulb staff."
"Great prices, expansive selection, excellent service, and packing/delivery is exceptional!  Been using 1000Bulbs for years!"
"Outstanding Custer service.  It’s always a pleasure doing business with a team of experts.  When you get a great company like this and the “same” advisor that knows you by name, you have a known quantity that understands you and your needs!  Great customer service and Connor is out representing the company and its values.  Bob Effler"

"I found regular A19 incandescent bulbs at 1000bulbs.com. My intention was to buy 3 dozen bulbs. The product says \"$3.84 each.\" And just to the left in the description, it says \"12 per case.\" So I started the order. When they wanted to charge me over $14 for shipping I decided it was worth it to pay this shipping rate for 36 bulbs since the product price was so good. $28 total. HOWEVER, I received 3 bulbs in an 8x8x8 box with foam peanuts. When I called to explain and complain, they said it's made clear further down in the description. I asked for a return shipping label to return the product. They said OK. The next day I receive an email with a return address and an explanation they don't pay for return shipping and that it might not be worth returning the bulbs. Wow! I emailed back to explain that they were using deceptive marketing practices and to please pay for return shipping and refund the returned product. No communication after that. I'm guessing they know people will get confused and depend on them not wanting to pay for return shipping. What a racket!  UPDATE: Once they saw my complaint, 1000bulbs immediately sent me a refund for the product, but not the shipping (which cost more than the product). They didn't respond to a request for shipping reimbursement."
"Ordered 3 light bulbs which were delivered within a few days. When I thought it was really great was that these bulbs were packed very securely a box that was a decent size and packed very carefully with Styrofoam peanuts. The box was secure, and I was very happy that they took extra care in packaging the lightbulbs to prevent breakage. I will order again from them because I feel very confident in their product and they’re shipping"
"Before contacting 1000 Bulbs, I had tried multiple other sites and an unsuccessful trip to a big box store to find LED replacement bulbs that fit our fixture. The chat operator responded immediately to my inquiry and located two options. The order arrived very quickly and the bulbs were exactly what I needed."
"The person who answered the phone was absolutelygreat because she was patient, smart, and when she could not find an item I requested she found another source for me to go to.That's Awesome!Thank you 1000bulbs!James Truesdale"
"Crystal at 1000Bulbs communicated clearly and promptly with me so I knew what was happening with my special order, when to expect it, and also answered the phone within 2 rings-so nice not to get an automated answering machine with many questions!  I actually received my order more quickly than expected.  Definitely I will call them if I have any more electrical needs!  Very nice company!"
"1000Bulbs had the exact replacement sockets I needed to rebuild a heat lamp for my restaurant. Easy ordering, fast shipping.."
"You are an extremely efficient and superior company to do business with, from start to finish. Placing the Oder is easy, no hassle. Shipping is quick.

"The best customer service - multiple names and numbers provided.Received order in less than four days.All bulbs lite up.Two hundred bulbs installed in less than five hours.Order Confirmation form is the best layout I have seen."
"Michael Said is a super technical adviser who helps our church on light bulbs selection. It is rare to have such a nice, knowledgeable person to help us when we need it."
"I've ordered from 1000 bulbs a few times before and always got what I wanted.  I'm reviewing them today after they DIDN'T have what I wanted.  I needed a specific kind of mini candelabra base with a \"cool\" (whiter) light.  A rep tried to find what I needed.  They didn't have it, but they referred me to a specific competitor who did have it.  THAT is customer service!"
"These guys always have the best prices on their lighting and are always helpful with our needs. They ship really quick, too.  The lights got here on Monday and were just ordered the Thursday before.  Thank you."

"My first time making a purchase with this company. Jordyn in customer service was very helpful with my order."
"I just received the sockets moments ago... They are of excellent quality. I would only suggest that you find a lower shipping cost. The items were overly packaged, and could easily have fit in a padded envelope."
"Finally the Christmas lights my wife has always wantedMy wife and I have been wanting to have a nice set of warm white lights lining the edge of our roof for years, I even built the house with outlets positioned to make it as clean and easy as possible, but I could never find a good dealer for high quality commercial grade cords and lights that I could customize to exact lengths, but now I have and we couldn’t be happier!!"

They didn't respond to a request for shipping reimbursement."
"Ordered 3 light bulbs which were delivered within a few days. When I thought it was really great was that these bulbs were packed very securely a box that was a decent size and packed very carefully with Styrofoam peanuts. The box was secure, and I was very happy that they took extra care in packaging the lightbulbs to prevent breakage. I will order again from them because I feel very confident in their product and they’re shipping"
"Before contacting 1000 Bulbs, I had tried multiple other sites and an unsuccessful trip to a big box store to find LED replacement bulbs that fit our fixture. The chat operator responded immediately to my inquiry and located two options. The order arrived very quickly and the bulbs were exactly what I needed."
"The person who answered the phone was absolutelygreat because she was patient, smart, and when she could not find an item I requested she found another source for me to go to.That's Awesome!Thank you 1000bulbs!James Truesdale"
"Crystal at 1000Bulbs communicated clearly and promptly with me so I knew what was happening with my special order, when to expect it, and also answered the phone within 2 rings-so nice not to get an automated answering machine with many questions!  I actually received my order more quickly than expected.  Definitely I will call them if I have any more electrical needs!  Very nice company!"
"1000Bulbs had the exact replacement sockets I needed to rebuild a heat lamp for my restaurant. Easy ordering, fast shipping.."
"You are an extremely efficient and superior company to do business with, from start to finish. Placing the Oder is easy, no hassle. Shipping is quick. And your packaging to keep the bulbs safe from damage is impeccable!  I have ordered from you before and was super pleased. That’s why I came back!!"
"1000Bulbs kicks ass! I got 25% off, received my order in 3 business days, and when I called for advice spoke to customer service immediately and had all my questions answered. I bought a socket spool and C7 lights for my house and it looks amazing."
"The best customer service - multiple names and numbers provided.Received order in less than four days.All bulbs lite up.Two hundred bulbs installed in less than five hours.Order Confirmation form is the best layout I have seen."
"Michael Said is a super technical adviser who helps our church on light bulbs selection. It is rare to have such a nice, knowledgeable person to help us when we need it."
"I've ordered from 1000 bulbs a few times before and always got what I wanted.  I'm reviewing them today after they DIDN'T have what I wanted.  I needed a specific kind of mini candelabra base with a \"cool\" (whiter) light.  A rep tried to find what I needed.  They didn't have it, but they referred me to a specific competitor who did have it.  THAT is customer service!"
"These guys always have the best prices on their lighting and are always helpful with our needs. They ship really quick, too.  The lights got here on Monday and were just ordered the Thursday before.  Thank you."
"Alexis Dominguez Was more than helpful. She had no issues dealing with the many changes we had and was always pleasant. Very knowledgeable and quick to respond!"
"I’ve had a difficult time finding clear bulbs for my bathroom heat lamp. They had exactly what I needed!  My order shipped quickly and was carefully packed to ensure the fragile bulbs arrived safely."
"My first time making a purchase with this company. Jordyn in customer service was very helpful with my order."
"I just received the sockets moments ago... They are of excellent quality. I would only suggest that you find a lower shipping cost. The items were overly packaged, and could easily have fit in a padded envelope."
"Finally the Christmas lights my wife has always wantedMy wife and I have been wanting to have a nice set of warm white lights lining the edge of our roof for years, I even built the house with outlets positioned to make it as clean and easy as possible, but I could never find a good dealer for high quality commercial grade cords and lights that I could customize to exact lengths, but now I have and we couldn’t be happier!!"
"The bulbs arrived in 2 days, they work beautifully, & you packed the shipment so carefully, your price was the best I've found; I bought the color changing led c9 bulbs"
"I've always had good experiences shopping here.  The prices are great and the selection is even better.  The filter tools are also well thought out to get you exactly what you're looking for."
"Order placed easy. Delivery was fast and in good condition. I made the mistake of ordering the wrong bulb. I was very disappointed that I couldn't return the item for exchange without paying a large amount of money. That's something I think may be helpful to change. But I was truly glad to find what I needed at your company"
"Alexis was extremely helpful and professional. She took her time to listen to my needs and sent price quotes promptly. Also. I needed help with tax exemption of which she was able to help. I received my globes in a very timely manner!!"
"Easy to find various options searching site for LED replacements for dual mini-flourescents with full specs listed, including base type, color (warmth), brightness (lumens), and interface (direct A/C and w/ballast and compatible with both).  Good price, and quick delivery.  Got exactly want I expected, site made it easy to reach and compare, and the LED replacement bulbs fit & works perfectly."
"Shipped in time but unfortunately my bulbs was damaged during transport but Kristin and Pam reacted super fast on my claim and send replacements! "
"For difficult to find bulbs especially LED replacements, 1000bulbs is the best. Their online interface is easy to use and fast. Shipping is expensive but fair and quick. All around good experience."
"As a contractor, I can say this is not the best place to go. I've done some level of business with 1000bulbs.com for years now. Our last project that we used 100 bulbs as a vendor will be our last purchase. Fixtures and lamps from same manufacturer at same color were not the same color lamps. We tried different products from 1000bulbs but were not able to get a color match. Had to go to one of our regular wholesalers before we could get the situation resolved. Lots of wasted time, jobsite labor and money with minimal help or real concern from the 1000bulb staff."
"Great prices, expansive selection, excellent service, and packing/delivery is exceptional!  Been using 1000Bulbs for years!"
"Outstanding Custer service.  It’s always a pleasure doing business with a team of experts.  When you get a great company like this and the “same” advisor that knows you by name, you have a known quantity that understands you and your needs!  Great customer service and Connor is out representing the company and its values.  Bob Effler"
"I have ordered from 1000Bulbs.com before and that is why I returned for a new set of specialty bulbs for some new fixtures I installed in my kitchen. The bulbs arrived very well packaged and all were functional."
"The salesman, Chad Pederson, the quality and ease of installment."
"Good price, product was exactly what I needed. Hard to find 5000k bulbs some times. Wish there were less expensive shipping option."
"I had a concern and they were immediately on top of it.It ended up being very minor (thank goodness). But they rectified it even though I told them it was not necessary. I will continue to use them for our light bulb needs."
"I bought their recommended 8' LED florescent replacement lamps for a commercial coffee roaster customer. These are for the ceiling fixtures in their warehouse.Using the lamp manufacturer's life rating, in this application (on 10 hours a day) they should have lasted 20 years. The first one failed after 3 months, now 2 more... so one by one they are failing and rather then sending out a better quality replacement at their cost, they are issuing pro-rated credits (sigh).To me this means they do not test the lamps or source high quality products, so beware that failure might be a common experience. Also, prorating the credits is sleezy and means they do not stand behind the items they recommend.Will I buy from them again? Nope!"
"I was struggling to find purple candlestick bulbs that actually glowed purple. I ordered and returned other brands several times because they looked pink or red when plugged in. The online rep shared a link to the comments about these lights (positive reviews for purple color) so I gave them a shot. I was not disappointed! They glow a nice true purple. Thanks for the help!"
"They helped me find exactly what I needed and had been looking in dozens of stores for. Best part is it all worked exactly as offered. "
"Easy ordering good product, price and delivery."
"Extremely happy with their customer service and their pricing.Have an account with them that was set up by a different person that is no longer with my organization (didn't know the sign in username or password). I spoke with the Commercial Account Manager and he changed the login information for me and took my order. After I gave him my order, he asked if there was anything else I needed or wanted. After I told him no, he explained to me their minimum order amount and free shipping. I ended up with an extra light fixture and a case of LED bulbs for less than my original order amount."
"Products arrived as commited, were well-packed and met expectations."
"The delivery was great, ordered it on Wednesday and got it on Saturday, over Thanksgiving, could not believe it. The quality of the products are excellent. Just finished installing all the lights and everything worked out perfectly. If and when I need more lighting equipment I will definitely purchase it from this company. Thanks"
"Customer service was helpful prior to ordering the LED Customer service was helpful prior to ordering the LED Christmas lights (pure white).  Order came quickly and the lights are perfect.  First, they do not flicker, just as the phone rep had assured me. Second, they are very bright, so much so that I bought a dimmer and the lights work perfectly with dimmer.  Only negative is price, but these kind of flicker-free LED light are expensive everywhere."

"I found regular A19 incandescent bulbs at 1000bulbs.com. My intention was to buy 3 dozen bulbs. The product says \"$3.84 each.\" And just to the left in the description, it says \"12 per case.\" So I started the order. When they wanted to charge me over $14 for shipping I decided it was worth it to pay this shipping rate for 36 bulbs since the product price was so good. $28 total. HOWEVER, I received 3 bulbs in an 8x8x8 box with foam peanuts. When I called to explain and complain, they said it's made clear further down in the description. I asked for a return shipping label to return the product. They said OK. The next day I receive an email with a return address and an explanation they don't pay for return shipping and that it might not be worth returning the bulbs. Wow! I emailed back to explain that they were using deceptive marketing practices and to please pay for return shipping and refund the returned product. No communication after that. I'm guessing they know people will get confused and depend on them not wanting to pay for return shipping. What a racket!  UPDATE: Once they saw my complaint, 1000bulbs immediately sent me a refund for the product, but not the shipping (which cost more than the product).

"Extremely happy with their customer service and their pricing.Have an account with them that was set up by a different person that is no longer with my organization (didn't know the sign in username or password). I spoke with the Commercial Account Manager and he changed the login information for me and took my order. After I gave him my order, he asked if there was anything else I needed or wanted. After I told him no, he explained to me their minimum order amount and free shipping. I ended up with an extra light fixture and a case of LED bulbs for less than my original order amount."
"Products arrived as commited, were well-packed and met expectations."
"The delivery was great, ordered it on Wednesday and got it on Saturday, over Thanksgiving, could not believe it. The quality of the products are excellent. Just finished installing all the lights and everything worked out perfectly. If and when I need more lighting equipment I will definitely purchase it from this company. Thanks"
"Customer service was helpful prior to ordering the LED Customer service was helpful prior to ordering the LED Christmas lights (pure white).  Order came quickly and the lights are perfect.  First, they do not flicker, just as the phone rep had assured me. Second, they are very bright, so much so that I bought a dimmer and the lights work perfectly with dimmer.  Only negative is price, but these kind of flicker-free LED light are expensive everywhere."
"I found regular A19 incandescent bulbs at 1000bulbs.com. My intention was to buy 3 dozen bulbs. The product says \"$3.84 each.\" And just to the left in the description, it says \"12 per case.\" So I started the order. When they wanted to charge me over $14 for shipping I decided it was worth it to pay this shipping rate for 36 bulbs since the product price was so good. $28 total. HOWEVER, I received 3 bulbs in an 8x8x8 box with foam peanuts. When I called to explain and complain, they said it's made clear further down in the description. I asked for a return shipping label to return the product. They said OK. The next day I receive an email with a return address and an explanation they don't pay for return shipping and that it might not be worth returning the bulbs. Wow! I emailed back to explain that they were using deceptive marketing practices and to please pay for return shipping and refund the returned product. No communication after that. I'm guessing they know people will get confused and depend on them not wanting to pay for return shipping. What a racket!  UPDATE: Once they saw my complaint, 1000bulbs immediately sent me a refund for the product, but not the shipping (which cost more than the product). They didn't respond to a request for shipping reimbursement."
"Ordered 3 light bulbs which were delivered within a few days. When I thought it was really great was that these bulbs were packed very securely a box that was a decent size and packed very carefully with Styrofoam peanuts. The box was secure, and I was very happy that they took extra care in packaging the lightbulbs to prevent breakage. I will order again from them because I feel very confident in their product and they’re shipping"
"Before contacting 1000 Bulbs, I had tried multiple other sites and an unsuccessful trip to a big box store to find LED replacement bulbs that fit our fixture. The chat operator responded immediately to my inquiry and located two options. The order arrived very quickly and the bulbs were exactly what I needed."
"The person who answered the phone was absolutelygreat because she was patient, smart, and when she could not find an item I requested she found another source for me to go to.That's Awesome!Thank you 1000bulbs!James Truesdale"
"Crystal at 1000Bulbs communicated clearly and promptly with me so I knew what was happening with my special order, when to expect it, and also answered the phone within 2 rings-so nice not to get an automated answering machine with many questions!  I actually received my order more quickly than expected.  Definitely I will call them if I have any more electrical needs!  Very nice company!"
"1000Bulbs had the exact replacement sockets I needed to rebuild a heat lamp for my restaurant. Easy ordering, fast shipping.."
"You are an extremely efficient and superior company to do business with, from start to finish. Placing the Oder is easy, no hassle. Shipping is quick. And your packaging to keep the bulbs safe from damage is impeccable!  I have ordered from you before and was super pleased. That’s why I came back!!"
"1000Bulbs kicks ass! I got 25% off, received my order in 3 business days, and when I called for advice spoke to customer service immediately and had all my questions answered. I bought a socket spool and C7 lights for my house and it looks amazing."
"The best customer service - multiple names and numbers provided.Received order in less than four days.All bulbs lite up.Two hundred bulbs installed in less than five hours.Order Confirmation form is the best layout I have seen."
"Michael Said is a super technical adviser who helps our church on light bulbs selection. It is rare to have such a nice, knowledgeable person to help us when we need it."
"I've ordered from 1000 bulbs a few times before and always got what I wanted.  I'm reviewing them today after they DIDN'T have what I wanted.  I needed a specific kind of mini candelabra base with a \"cool\" (whiter) light.  A rep tried to find what I needed.  They didn't have it, but they referred me to a specific competitor who did have it.  THAT is customer service!"
"These guys always have the best prices on their lighting and are always helpful with our needs. They ship really quick, too.  The lights got here on Monday and were just ordered the Thursday before.  Thank you."
"Alexis Dominguez Was more than helpful. She had no issues dealing with the many changes we had and was always pleasant. Very knowledgeable and quick to respond!"
"I’ve had a difficult time finding clear bulbs for my bathroom heat lamp. They had exactly what I needed!  My order shipped quickly and was carefully packed to ensure the fragile bulbs arrived safely."
"My first time making a purchase with this company. Jordyn in customer service was very helpful with my order."
"I just received the sockets moments ago... They are of excellent quality. I would only suggest that you find a lower shipping cost. The items were overly packaged, and could easily have fit in a padded envelope."
"Finally the Christmas lights my wife has always wantedMy wife and I have been wanting to have a nice set of warm white lights lining the edge of our roof for years, I even built the house with outlets positioned to make it as clean and easy as possible, but I could never find a good dealer for high quality commercial grade cords and lights that I could customize to exact lengths, but now I have and we couldn’t be happier!!"
"The bulbs arrived in 2 days, they work beautifully, & you packed the shipment so carefully, your price was the best I've found; I bought the color changing led c9 bulbs"
"I've always had good experiences shopping here.  The prices are great and the selection is even better.  The filter tools are also well thought out to get you exactly what you're looking for."
"Order placed easy. Delivery was fast and in good condition. I made the mistake of ordering the wrong bulb. I was very disappointed that I couldn't return the item for exchange without paying a large amount of money. That's something I think may be helpful to change. But I was truly glad to find what I needed at your company"
"Alexis was extremely helpful and professional. She took her time to listen to my needs and sent price quotes promptly. Also. I needed help with tax exemption of which she was able to help. I received my globes in a very timely manner!!"
"Easy to find various options searching site for LED replacements for dual mini-flourescents with full specs listed, including base type, color (warmth), brightness (lumens), and interface (direct A/C and w/ballast and compatible with both).  Good price, and quick delivery.  Got exactly want I expected, site made it easy to reach and compare, and the LED replacement bulbs fit & works perfectly."
"Shipped in time but unfortunately my bulbs was damaged during transport but Kristin and Pam reacted super fast on my claim and send replacements! "
"For difficult to find bulbs especially LED replacements, 1000bulbs is the best. Their online interface is easy to use and fast. Shipping is expensive but fair and quick. All around good experience."
"As a contractor, I can say this is not the best place to go. I've done some level of business with 1000bulbs.com for years now. Our last project that we used 100 bulbs as a vendor will be our last purchase. Fixtures and lamps from same manufacturer at same color were not the same color lamps. We tried different products from 1000bulbs but were not able to get a color match. Had to go to one of our regular wholesalers before we could get the situation resolved. Lots of wasted time, jobsite labor and money with minimal help or real concern from the 1000bulb staff."
"Great prices, expansive selection, excellent service, and packing/delivery is exceptional!  Been using 1000Bulbs for years!"
"Outstanding Custer service.  It’s always a pleasure doing business with a team of experts.  When you get a great company like this and the “same” advisor that knows you by name, you have a known quantity that understands you and your needs!  Great customer service and Connor is out representing the company and its values.  Bob Effler"
"I have ordered from 1000Bulbs.com before and that is why I returned for a new set of specialty bulbs for some new fixtures I installed in my kitchen. The bulbs arrived very well packaged and all were functional."
"The salesman, Chad Pederson, the quality and ease of installment."
"Good price, product was exactly what I needed. Hard to find 5000k bulbs some times. Wish there were less expensive shipping option."
"I had a concern and they were immediately on top of it.It ended up being very minor (thank goodness). But they rectified it even though I told them it was not necessary. I will continue to use them for our light bulb needs."
"I bought their recommended 8' LED florescent replacement lamps for a commercial coffee roaster customer. These are for the ceiling fixtures in their warehouse.Using the lamp manufacturer's life rating, in this application (on 10 hours a day) they should have lasted 20 years. The first one failed after 3 months, now 2 more... so one by one they are failing and rather then sending out a better quality replacement at their cost, they are issuing pro-rated credits (sigh).To me this means they do not test the lamps or source high quality products, so beware that failure might be a common experience. Also, prorating the credits is sleezy and means they do not stand behind the items they recommend.Will I buy from them again? Nope!"
"I was struggling to find purple candlestick bulbs that actually glowed purple. I ordered and returned other brands several times because they looked pink or red when plugged in. The online rep shared a link to the comments about these lights (positive reviews for purple color) so I gave them a shot. I was not disappointed! They glow a nice true purple. Thanks for the help!"

After I told him no, he explained to me their minimum order amount and free shipping. I ended up with an extra light fixture and a case of LED bulbs for less than my original order amount."
"Products arrived as commited, were well-packed and met expectations."
"The delivery was great, ordered it on Wednesday and got it on Saturday, over Thanksgiving, could not believe it. The quality of the products are excellent. Just finished installing all the lights and everything worked out perfectly. If and when I need more lighting equipment I will definitely purchase it from this company. Thanks"
"Customer service was helpful prior to ordering the LED Customer service was helpful prior to ordering the LED Christmas lights (pure white).  Order came quickly and the lights are perfect.  First, they do not flicker, just as the phone rep had assured me. Second, they are very bright, so much so that I bought a dimmer and the lights work perfectly with dimmer.  Only negative is price, but these kind of flicker-free LED light are expensive everywhere."
"Order placed easy. Delivery was fast and in good condition. I made the mistake of ordering the wrong bulb. I was very disappointed that I couldn't return the item for exchange without paying a large amount of money. That's something I think may be helpful to change. But I was truly glad to find what I needed at your company"
"Alexis was extremely helpful and professional. She took her time to listen to my needs and sent price quotes promptly. Also. I needed help with tax exemption of which she was able to help. I received my globes in a very timely manner!!"
"Easy to find various options searching site for LED replacements for dual mini-flourescents with full specs listed, including base type, color (warmth), brightness (lumens), and interface (direct A/C and w/ballast and compatible with both).  Good price, and quick delivery.  Got exactly want I expected, site made it easy to reach and compare, and the LED replacement bulbs fit & works perfectly."
"Shipped in time but unfortunately my bulbs was damaged during transport but Kristin and Pam reacted super fast on my claim and send replacements! "
"For difficult to find bulbs especially LED replacements, 1000bulbs is the best. Their online interface is easy to use and fast. Shipping is expensive but fair and quick. All around good experience."
"As a contractor, I can say this is not the best place to go. I've done some level of business with 1000bulbs.com for years now. Our last project that we used 100 bulbs as a vendor will be our last purchase. Fixtures and lamps from same manufacturer at same color were not the same color lamps. We tried different products from 1000bulbs but were not able to get a color match. Had to go to one of our regular wholesalers before we could get the situation resolved. Lots of wasted time, jobsite labor and money with minimal help or real concern from the 1000bulb staff."
"Great prices, expansive selection, excellent service, and packing/delivery is exceptional!  Been using 1000Bulbs for years!"
"Outstanding Custer service.  It’s always a pleasure doing business with a team of experts.  When you get a great company like this and the “same” advisor that knows you by name, you have a known quantity that understands you and your needs!  Great customer service and Connor is out representing the company and its values.  Bob Effler"
"I have ordered from 1000Bulbs.com before and that is why I returned for a new set of specialty bulbs for some new fixtures I installed in my kitchen. The bulbs arrived very well packaged and all were functional."
"The salesman, Chad Pederson, the quality and ease of installment."
"Good price, product was exactly what I needed. Hard to find 5000k bulbs some times. Wish there were less expensive shipping option."
"I had a concern and they were immediately on top of it.It ended up being very minor (thank goodness). But they rectified it even though I told them it was not necessary. I will continue to use them for our light bulb needs."
"I bought their recommended 8' LED florescent replacement lamps for a commercial coffee roaster customer. These are for the ceiling fixtures in their warehouse.Using the lamp manufacturer's life rating, in this application (on 10 hours a day) they should have lasted 20 years. The first one failed after 3 months, now 2 more... so one by one they are failing and rather then sending out a better quality replacement at their cost, they are issuing pro-rated credits (sigh).To me this means they do not test the lamps or source high quality products, so beware that failure might be a common experience. Also, prorating the credits is sleezy and means they do not stand behind the items they recommend.Will I buy from them again? Nope!"
"I was struggling to find purple candlestick bulbs that actually glowed purple. I ordered and returned other brands several times because they looked pink or red when plugged in. The online rep shared a link to the comments about these lights (positive reviews for purple color) so I gave them a shot. I was not disappointed! They glow a nice true purple. Thanks for the help!"
"They helped me find exactly what I needed and had been looking in dozens of stores for. Best part is it all worked exactly as offered. "
"Easy ordering good product, price and delivery."

"I found regular A19 incandescent bulbs at 1000bulbs.com. My intention was to buy 3 dozen bulbs. The product says \"$3.84 each.\" And just to the left in the description, it says \"12 per case.\" So I started the order. When they wanted to charge me over $14 for shipping I decided it was worth it to pay this shipping rate for 36 bulbs since the product price was so good. $28 total. HOWEVER, I received 3 bulbs in an 8x8x8 box with foam peanuts. When I called to explain and complain, they said it's made clear further down in the description. I asked for a return shipping label to return the product. They said OK. The next day I receive an email with a return address and an explanation they don't pay for return shipping and that it might not be worth returning the bulbs. Wow! I emailed back to explain that they were using deceptive marketing practices and to please pay for return shipping and refund the returned product. No communication after that. I'm guessing they know people will get confused and depend on them not wanting to pay for return shipping. What a racket!  UPDATE: Once they saw my complaint, 1000bulbs immediately sent me a refund for the product, but not the shipping (which cost more than the product). They didn't respond to a request for shipping reimbursement."
"Ordered 3 light bulbs which were delivered within a few days. When I thought it was really great was that these bulbs were packed very securely a box that was a decent size and packed very carefully with Styrofoam peanuts. The box was secure, and I was very happy that they took extra care in packaging the lightbulbs to prevent breakage. I will order again from them because I feel very confident in their product and they’re shipping"
"Before contacting 1000 Bulbs, I had tried multiple other sites and an unsuccessful trip to a big box store to find LED replacement bulbs that fit our fixture. The chat operator responded immediately to my inquiry and located two options. The order arrived very quickly and the bulbs were exactly what I needed."
"The person who answered the phone was absolutelygreat because she was patient, smart, and when she could not find an item I requested she found another source for me to go to.That's Awesome!Thank you 1000bulbs!James Truesdale"
"Crystal at 1000Bulbs communicated clearly and promptly with me so I knew what was happening with my special order, when to expect it, and also answered the phone within 2 rings-so nice not to get an automated answering machine with many questions!  I actually received my order more quickly than expected.  Definitely I will call them if I have any more electrical needs!  Very nice company!"
"1000Bulbs had the exact replacement sockets I needed to rebuild a heat lamp for my restaurant. Easy ordering, fast shipping.."
"You are an extremely efficient and superior company to do business with, from start to finish. Placing the Oder is easy, no hassle. Shipping is quick. And your packaging to keep the bulbs safe from damage is impeccable!  I have ordered from you before and was super pleased. That’s why I came back!!"
"1000Bulbs kicks ass! I got 25% off, received my order in 3 business days, and when I called for advice spoke to customer service immediately and had all my questions answered. I bought a socket spool and C7 lights for my house and it looks amazing."
"The best customer service - multiple names and numbers provided.Received order in less than four days.All bulbs lite up.Two hundred bulbs installed in less than five hours.Order Confirmation form is the best layout I have seen."
"Michael Said is a super technical adviser who helps our church on light bulbs selection. It is rare to have such a nice, knowledgeable person to help us when we need it."
"I've ordered from 1000 bulbs a few times before and always got what I wanted.  I'm reviewing them today after they DIDN'T have what I wanted.  I needed a specific kind of mini candelabra base with a \"cool\" (whiter) light.  A rep tried to find what I needed.  They didn't have it, but they referred me to a specific competitor who did have it.  THAT is customer service!"
"These guys always have the best prices on their lighting and are always helpful with our needs. They ship really quick, too.  The lights got here on Monday and were just ordered the Thursday before.  Thank you."
"Alexis Dominguez Was more than helpful. She had no issues dealing with the many changes we had and was always pleasant. Very knowledgeable and quick to respond!"
"I’ve had a difficult time finding clear bulbs for my bathroom heat lamp. They had exactly what I needed!  My order shipped quickly and was carefully packed to ensure the fragile bulbs arrived safely."
"My first time making a purchase with this company. Jordyn in customer service was very helpful with my order."
"I just received the sockets moments ago... They are of excellent quality. I would only suggest that you find a lower shipping cost. The items were overly packaged, and could easily have fit in a padded envelope."
"Finally the Christmas lights my wife has always wantedMy wife and I have been wanting to have a nice set of warm white lights lining the edge of our roof for years, I even built the house with outlets positioned to make it as clean and easy as possible, but I could never find a good dealer for high quality commercial grade cords and lights that I could customize to exact lengths, but now I have and we couldn’t be happier!!"
"The bulbs arrived in 2 days, they work beautifully, & you packed the shipment so carefully, your price was the best I've found; I bought the color changing led c9 bulbs"
"I've always had good experiences shopping here.  The prices are great and the selection is even better.  The filter tools are also well thought out to get you exactly what you're looking for."
"Order placed easy. Delivery was fast and in good condition. I made the mistake of ordering the wrong bulb.

"Great prices, expansive selection, excellent service, and packing/delivery is exceptional!  Been using 1000Bulbs for years!"
"Outstanding Custer service.  It’s always a pleasure doing business with a team of experts.  When you get a great company like this and the “same” advisor that knows you by name, you have a known quantity that understands you and your needs!  Great customer service and Connor is out representing the company and its values.  Bob Effler"
"I have ordered from 1000Bulbs.com before and that is why I returned for a new set of specialty bulbs for some new fixtures I installed in my kitchen. The bulbs arrived very well packaged and all were functional."
"The salesman, Chad Pederson, the quality and ease of installment."
"Good price, product was exactly what I needed. Hard to find 5000k bulbs some times. Wish there were less expensive shipping option."
"I had a concern and they were immediately on top of it.It ended up being very minor (thank goodness). But they rectified it even though I told them it was not necessary. I will continue to use them for our light bulb needs."
"I bought their recommended 8' LED florescent replacement lamps for a commercial coffee roaster customer. These are for the ceiling fixtures in their warehouse.Using the lamp manufacturer's life rating, in this application (on 10 hours a day) they should have lasted 20 years. The first one failed after 3 months, now 2 more... so one by one they are failing and rather then sending out a better quality replacement at their cost, they are issuing pro-rated credits (sigh).To me this means they do not test the lamps or source high quality products, so beware that failure might be a common experience. Also, prorating the credits is sleezy and means they do not stand behind the items they recommend.Will I buy from them again? Nope!"
"I was struggling to find purple candlestick bulbs that actually glowed purple. I ordered and returned other brands several times because they looked pink or red when plugged in. The online rep shared a link to the comments about these lights (positive reviews for purple color) so I gave them a shot. I was not disappointed! They glow a nice true purple. Thanks for the help!"
"They helped me find exactly what I needed and had been looking in dozens of stores for. Best part is it all worked exactly as offered. "
"Easy ordering good product, price and delivery."
"Extremely happy with their customer service and their pricing.Have an account with them that was set up by a different person that is no longer with my organization (didn't know the sign in username or password). I spoke with the Commercial Account Manager and he changed the login information for me and took my order. After I gave him my order, he asked if there was anything else I needed or wanted. After I told him no, he explained to me their minimum order amount and free shipping. I ended up with an extra light fixture and a case of LED bulbs for less than my original order amount."
"Products arrived as commited, were well-packed and met expectations."
"The delivery was great, ordered it on Wednesday and got it on Saturday, over Thanksgiving, could not believe it. The quality of the products are excellent. Just finished installing all the lights and everything worked out perfectly. If and when I need more lighting equipment I will definitely purchase it from this company. Thanks"
"Customer service was helpful prior to ordering the LED Customer service was helpful prior to ordering the LED Christmas lights (pure white).  Order came quickly and the lights are perfect.  First, they do not flicker, just as the phone rep had assured me. Second, they are very bright, so much so that I bought a dimmer and the lights work perfectly with dimmer.  Only negative is price, but these kind of flicker-free LED light are expensive everywhere."
"Order placed easy. Delivery was fast and in good condition. I made the mistake of ordering the wrong bulb. I was very disappointed that I couldn't return the item for exchange without paying a large amount of money. That's something I think may be helpful to change. But I was truly glad to find what I needed at your company"
"Alexis was extremely helpful and professional. She took her time to listen to my needs and sent price quotes promptly. Also. I needed help with tax exemption of which she was able to help. I received my globes in a very timely manner!!"
"Easy to find various options searching site for LED replacements for dual mini-flourescents with full specs listed, including base type, color (warmth), brightness (lumens), and interface (direct A/C and w/ballast and compatible with both).  Good price, and quick delivery.  Got exactly want I expected, site made it easy to reach and compare, and the LED replacement bulbs fit & works perfectly."
"Shipped in time but unfortunately my bulbs was damaged during transport but Kristin and Pam reacted super fast on my claim and send replacements! "
"For difficult to find bulbs especially LED replacements, 1000bulbs is the best. Their online interface is easy to use and fast. Shipping is expensive but fair and quick. All around good experience."
"As a contractor, I can say this is not the best place to go. I've done some level of business with 1000bulbs.com for years now. Our last project that we used 100 bulbs as a vendor will be our last purchase. Fixtures and lamps from same manufacturer at same color were not the same color lamps. We tried different products from 1000bulbs but were not able to get a color match. Had to go to one of our regular wholesalers before we could get the situation resolved. Lots of wasted time, jobsite labor and money with minimal help or real concern from the 1000bulb staff."

"I found regular A19 incandescent bulbs at 1000bulbs.com. My intention was to buy 3 dozen bulbs. The product says \"$3.84 each.\" And just to the left in the description, it says \"12 per case.\" So I started the order. When they wanted to charge me over $14 for shipping I decided it was worth it to pay this shipping rate for 36 bulbs since the product price was so good. $28 total. HOWEVER, I received 3 bulbs in an 8x8x8 box with foam peanuts. When I called to explain and complain, they said it's made clear further down in the description. I asked for a return shipping label to return the product. They said OK. The next day I receive an email with a return address and an explanation they don't pay for return shipping and that it might not be worth returning the bulbs. Wow! I emailed back to explain that they were using deceptive marketing practices and to please pay for return shipping and refund the returned product. No communication after that. I'm guessing they know people will get confused and depend on them not wanting to pay for return shipping. What a racket!  UPDATE: Once they saw my complaint, 1000bulbs immediately sent me a refund for the product, but not the shipping (which cost more than the product). They didn't respond to a request for shipping reimbursement."
"Ordered 3 light bulbs which were delivered within a few days. When I thought it was really great was that these bulbs were packed very securely a box that was a decent size and packed very carefully with Styrofoam peanuts. The box was secure, and I was very happy that they took extra care in packaging the lightbulbs to prevent breakage. I will order again from them because I feel very confident in their product and they’re shipping"
"Before contacting 1000 Bulbs, I had tried multiple other sites and an unsuccessful trip to a big box store to find LED replacement bulbs that fit our fixture. The chat operator responded immediately to my inquiry and located two options. The order arrived very quickly and the bulbs were exactly what I needed."
"The person who answered the phone was absolutelygreat because she was patient, smart, and when she could not find an item I requested she found another source for me to go to.That's Awesome!Thank you 1000bulbs!James Truesdale"
"Crystal at 1000Bulbs communicated clearly and promptly with me so I knew what was happening with my special order, when to expect it, and also answered the phone within 2 rings-so nice not to get an automated answering machine with many questions!  I actually received my order more quickly than expected.  Definitely I will call them if I have any more electrical needs!  Very nice company!"
"1000Bulbs had the exact replacement sockets I needed to rebuild a heat lamp for my restaurant. Easy ordering, fast shipping.."
"You are an extremely efficient and superior company to do business with, from start to finish. Placing the Oder is easy, no hassle. Shipping is quick. And your packaging to keep the bulbs safe from damage is impeccable!  I have ordered from you before and was super pleased. That’s why I came back!!"
"1000Bulbs kicks ass! I got 25% off, received my order in 3 business days, and when I called for advice spoke to customer service immediately and had all my questions answered. I bought a socket spool and C7 lights for my house and it looks amazing."
"The best customer service - multiple names and numbers provided.Received order in less than four days.All bulbs lite up.Two hundred bulbs installed in less than five hours.Order Confirmation form is the best layout I have seen."
"Michael Said is a super technical adviser who helps our church on light bulbs selection. It is rare to have such a nice, knowledgeable person to help us when we need it."
"I've ordered from 1000 bulbs a few times before and always got what I wanted.  I'm reviewing them today after they DIDN'T have what I wanted.  I needed a specific kind of mini candelabra base with a \"cool\" (whiter) light.  A rep tried to find what I needed.  They didn't have it, but they referred me to a specific competitor who did have it.  THAT is customer service!"
"These guys always have the best prices on their lighting and are always helpful with our needs. They ship really quick, too.  The lights got here on Monday and were just ordered the Thursday before.  Thank you."
"Alexis Dominguez Was more than helpful. She had no issues dealing with the many changes we had and was always pleasant. Very knowledgeable and quick to respond!"
"I’ve had a difficult time finding clear bulbs for my bathroom heat lamp. They had exactly what I needed!  My order shipped quickly and was carefully packed to ensure the fragile bulbs arrived safely."
"My first time making a purchase with this company. Jordyn in customer service was very helpful with my order."
"I just received the sockets moments ago... They are of excellent quality. I would only suggest that you find a lower shipping cost. The items were overly packaged, and could easily have fit in a padded envelope."
"Finally the Christmas lights my wife has always wantedMy wife and I have been wanting to have a nice set of warm white lights lining the edge of our roof for years, I even built the house with outlets positioned to make it as clean and easy as possible, but I could never find a good dealer for high quality commercial grade cords and lights that I could customize to exact lengths, but now I have and we couldn’t be happier!!"
"The bulbs arrived in 2 days, they work beautifully, & you packed the shipment so carefully, your price was the best I've found; I bought the color changing led c9 bulbs"
"I've always had good experiences shopping here.  The prices are great and the selection is even better.  The filter tools are also well thought out to get you exactly what you're looking for."

"I ordered a case of T8 flourescent bulbs from them.  The box was not marked fragile, glass, or in anyway to indicate the contents. FedEx delivered and proceeded to throw the box 2+ feet onto my concrete porch.  I immediately contacted them asking for some compensation (reduction on the order). Nope, I have 1 week to inspect each bulb in the case (i.e. individually test each bulb in a fixture to make sure it works) and then re-contact them to reconcille the issue.  I have shared with them the Ring Doorbell video of the driver throwing the box but 1000Bulbs does not care.  Leaving tomorrow for an extended international business trip so the 1 week period to assess damages is just not possible.   "

"The bulbs that I ordered were not the same as I had before.  They were about 5/8\" shorter.  My concern was the description did not give the dimensions so I could not compare with the old one.  The end result worked out good.  The brightness (lumens) were about the same and it matched the two other bulbs in the lamp fixture.  So far, so good! "

"Your instructions on bypassing the ballast (how-to-bypass-a-ballast) creates a short circuit which (hopefully) will blow the circuit breaker when the light is turned on. The power needs to be connected to each end of the LED light, not to each terminal on one end. The terminals on each end are connected together - thus the short circuit."
"Just what I needed, at a great price, shipped immediately. Thank you."
"The price was very good, and shipping was fast.This why i came back again."
"1000Bulbs definitely definitely does not stand behind their products and the customer service is appalling. I bought lightbulbs from their website, which do NOT dim as described. They are very low-quality imported bulbs that do not indicate any dimmability feature on the bulbs or packaging. I spent almost $20 to have the bulbs shipped to me and they do not work. I contacted the company for a return and refund and they refused to pay return shipping. I would not need to return them if their website did not misrepresent the product! Buyer beware!"
"Online ordering and updates on shipping made for a swift delivery"
"good customer service. Quick shipping. Good deal."
"***This is the original review I left (1 star), I'm updating to 2 stars and will explain why below***I've been an electrician for 20 years, 11 running my own shop, and have NEVER experienced such horrendous service. We purchased overhead lights for a job, the light didn't spread as described, so we had to send back (over $400 shipping which we had to pay), only for them to tell us they couldn't return the product because we put a piece of electrical tape on the end of the dimming wire leads to secure the rubber caps, which were falling off. They refused to spend 5 minutes pulling tape off (which was necessary anyway), and now won't refund thousands of dollars worth of product (which they now have!). After repeated calls and emails with service rep, I asked to be put into contact with his supervisor, which he refused to do so, so I'm hoping someone else in the company sees this and reaches out to resolve this issue.I purchased over $12,000 with my first two orders with this company in just over a month, and now they're effectively stealing thousands from us. Not only is this morally reprehensible, but it's just terrible business. We have a lot of buying power potential, and unless someone straightens this out, you've lost all those future sales.I do hope someone reaches out to hear the rest of this story and tries to make it right.***UPDATE 4-29-24***Nobody ever reached out to me, however, I was able to contact a supervisor through backdoor means. She was very apologetic about the situation and assured me they were working on the return, which they did refund most of the money, minus the $425 shipping and a 15% restocking fee. Considering the entire problem was due to the inaccuracy of the product claims, I still feel shorted on the situation, but at this point I'll accept the loss and move on, take all my future business elsewhere, and would advise others to strongly consider this before ordering from them."
"This store has been really good supplier of mine."
"I placed my order. They went to work on it. My bulbs arrived in a few days. Everything went well. No complaints."
