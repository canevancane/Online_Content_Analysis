"I love Nebraska furniture mart.They are amazing period I normally purchase things to be delivered to my house and if people that show up put the stuff together very quickly.

"Everything that we tend to purchase from Nebraska Furniture mart is no longer available in the store.  We have to order it and then set up a time to get it delivered, or pick it up from the store, or in the case of smaller items delivered to our home.  Gone are the days that we could go to the store and purchase said item and leave the store with that item.  At this point since the items we are interested in are not in store, we have no motivation to go to the store location at all, thus causing the company to lose out on impulse purchases.  The online checkout process needs to be streamlined, and products need to be carried in the store.  NFM used to be a store we would travel to once a month and purchase something.  Now, it's a once or twice a year.  And maybe a few times more online.  "

There are plenty of companies out there that are third-party companies that verify military IDs and that whatever companies using them you can then apply to any purchases and I think it would be very helpful if this was something that Nebraska Furniture Mart had."

Now, it's a once or twice a year.  And maybe a few times more online.  "

"Everything that we tend to purchase from Nebraska Furniture mart is no longer available in the store.  We have to order it and then set up a time to get it delivered, or pick it up from the store, or in the case of smaller items delivered to our home.

There are plenty of companies out there that are third-party companies that verify military IDs and that whatever companies using them you can then apply to any purchases and I think it would be very helpful if this was something that Nebraska Furniture Mart had."

"I am writing to express my profound disappointment and dissatisfaction with the flooring work conducted by Nebraska Furniture. The experience my family and I have endured has been nothing short of frustrating and disheartening.Below is a detailed timeline of the events surrounding the flooring challenges we have faced:â€¢	July 12th: Flooring selection made, and the order promptly placed.â€¢	August 17th: Initial delivery scheduled (Order #78292892).â€¢	August 17th: Delivery received, and vinyl left to acclimate until August 21st.â€¢	August 21st: Project commenced; my family had to temporarily relocate due to construction.â€¢	August 23rd: Project put on hold due to a bad batch of materials.â€¢	August 25th: Informed of the issue and asked to select a new product.â€¢	August 28th: New material delivery scheduled.â€¢	August 28th: Second batch found to be defective.â€¢	September 8th: New color selected with assurances of expedited service.â€¢	September (ongoing): Numerous calls for updates, with a projected 10/17 delivery date.The frustration and inconvenience we have experienced throughout this process cannot be overstated. Our home has been in disarray for months, and the continual delays have taken a significant toll on us both mentally and emotionally.As a loyal customer of Nebraska Furniture since its establishment in Texas in 2015, and a card member for a similar duration, I have always valued the convenience and quality of your products. Over the years, I have purchased furniture for various rooms in my home without encountering any issues, except for the challenges faced during the COVID shutdown, which were understandable given global supply chain disruptions. I have even recommended your store to family and friends.Regrettably, despite providing this detailed account to the management team, I have not received a response. This lack of communication and resolution is deeply disappointing. At this point, I am left with no choice but NOT to do any further business with Nebraska Furniture. Furthermore, I intend to share my experience with everyone I know, as transparency regarding customer service is essential.I kindly request an immediate intervention from an executive or management member to expedite the resolution of this matter and find a flooring solution that aligns with the standards I have come to expect from Nebraska Furniture. Enclosed are pictures that illustrate the challenges my family has faced during this ordeal."

"Everything that we tend to purchase from Nebraska Furniture mart is no longer available in the store.  We have to order it and then set up a time to get it delivered, or pick it up from the store, or in the case of smaller items delivered to our home.  Gone are the days that we could go to the store and purchase said item and leave the store with that item.  At this point since the items we are interested in are not in store, we have no motivation to go to the store location at all, thus causing the company to lose out on impulse purchases.  The online checkout process needs to be streamlined, and products need to be carried in the store.  NFM used to be a store we would travel to once a month and purchase something.  Now, it's a once or twice a year.  And maybe a few times more online.  "

There are plenty of companies out there that are third-party companies that verify military IDs and that whatever companies using them you can then apply to any purchases and I think it would be very helpful if this was something that Nebraska Furniture Mart had."

"I am writing to express my profound disappointment and dissatisfaction with the flooring work conducted by Nebraska Furniture. The experience my family and I have endured has been nothing short of frustrating and disheartening.Below is a detailed timeline of the events surrounding the flooring challenges we have faced:â€¢	July 12th: Flooring selection made, and the order promptly placed.â€¢	August 17th: Initial delivery scheduled (Order #78292892).â€¢	August 17th: Delivery received, and vinyl left to acclimate until August 21st.â€¢	August 21st: Project commenced; my family had to temporarily relocate due to construction.â€¢	August 23rd: Project put on hold due to a bad batch of materials.â€¢	August 25th: Informed of the issue and asked to select a new product.â€¢	August 28th: New material delivery scheduled.â€¢	August 28th: Second batch found to be defective.â€¢	September 8th: New color selected with assurances of expedited service.â€¢	September (ongoing): Numerous calls for updates, with a projected 10/17 delivery date.The frustration and inconvenience we have experienced throughout this process cannot be overstated. Our home has been in disarray for months, and the continual delays have taken a significant toll on us both mentally and emotionally.As a loyal customer of Nebraska Furniture since its establishment in Texas in 2015, and a card member for a similar duration, I have always valued the convenience and quality of your products. Over the years, I have purchased furniture for various rooms in my home without encountering any issues, except for the challenges faced during the COVID shutdown, which were understandable given global supply chain disruptions. I have even recommended your store to family and friends.Regrettably, despite providing this detailed account to the management team, I have not received a response. This lack of communication and resolution is deeply disappointing. At this point, I am left with no choice but NOT to do any further business with Nebraska Furniture. Furthermore, I intend to share my experience with everyone I know, as transparency regarding customer service is essential.I kindly request an immediate intervention from an executive or management member to expedite the resolution of this matter and find a flooring solution that aligns with the standards I have come to expect from Nebraska Furniture. Enclosed are pictures that illustrate the challenges my family has faced during this ordeal."

"Excellent Experience in online purchse; Convenient, easy to coordinate everything I needed to purchase, customer service easy to contact and quick to answer and respond through online chat when I had a question about purchase. Very pleased with overall process and efficiency. "
"24 month no interest financing really helps. Also, product cost is awesome. I would like more color options in leather recliner sofas  (grey please)"
"$100 store credit for damaged appliance. Had to pay over 30 bucks for shipping and handeling. What a crock! Probably will not shop with your store ever again!"

"I need a dishwasher like yesterday so thanks for having one in stock NFM"
"Everything that we tend to purchase from Nebraska Furniture mart is no longer available in the store.  We have to order it and then set up a time to get it delivered, or pick it up from the store, or in the case of smaller items delivered to our home.  Gone are the days that we could go to the store and purchase said item and leave the store with that item.  At this point since the items we are interested in are not in store, we have no motivation to go to the store location at all, thus causing the company to lose out on impulse purchases.  The online checkout process needs to be streamlined, and products need to be carried in the store.  NFM used to be a store we would travel to once a month and purchase something.  Now, it's a once or twice a year.  And maybe a few times more online.  "
"Easy online shopping, no-interest credit card, all around good experience each time."
"Easy checkout and great prices. You can always find something at NFM. My new go to place for shopping. "
"easy to order on line. we have purchased a lot of items from nfm over the years and we were always satisfied with everthing."
"easy to check out and the same day delivery option is AMAZING!"
"Very easy except for the system saying my address does not exist. Over all a good process."
"Good selection but when trying to checkout, the system was telling me my expiration date on my card was wrong, I had to resubmit like 5 times, then it finally accepted it. What a pain ðŸ˜ž hopefully delivery will be easier and the chairs I ordered will be worth it"
"The option to shop and order online and then pick my pick-up or delivery date.  The whole process was very easy and efficient. Berkshire prices were clearly marked and I appreciated the shareholder discount during this time period. "

There are plenty of companies out there that are third-party companies that verify military IDs and that whatever companies using them you can then apply to any purchases and I think it would be very helpful if this was something that Nebraska Furniture Mart had."

"I am writing to express my profound disappointment and dissatisfaction with the flooring work conducted by Nebraska Furniture. The experience my family and I have endured has been nothing short of frustrating and disheartening.Below is a detailed timeline of the events surrounding the flooring challenges we have faced:â€¢	July 12th: Flooring selection made, and the order promptly placed.â€¢	August 17th: Initial delivery scheduled (Order #78292892).â€¢	August 17th: Delivery received, and vinyl left to acclimate until August 21st.â€¢	August 21st: Project commenced; my family had to temporarily relocate due to construction.â€¢	August 23rd: Project put on hold due to a bad batch of materials.â€¢	August 25th: Informed of the issue and asked to select a new product.â€¢	August 28th: New material delivery scheduled.â€¢	August 28th: Second batch found to be defective.â€¢	September 8th: New color selected with assurances of expedited service.â€¢	September (ongoing): Numerous calls for updates, with a projected 10/17 delivery date.The frustration and inconvenience we have experienced throughout this process cannot be overstated. Our home has been in disarray for months, and the continual delays have taken a significant toll on us both mentally and emotionally.As a loyal customer of Nebraska Furniture since its establishment in Texas in 2015, and a card member for a similar duration, I have always valued the convenience and quality of your products. Over the years, I have purchased furniture for various rooms in my home without encountering any issues, except for the challenges faced during the COVID shutdown, which were understandable given global supply chain disruptions. I have even recommended your store to family and friends.Regrettably, despite providing this detailed account to the management team, I have not received a response. This lack of communication and resolution is deeply disappointing. At this point, I am left with no choice but NOT to do any further business with Nebraska Furniture. Furthermore, I intend to share my experience with everyone I know, as transparency regarding customer service is essential.I kindly request an immediate intervention from an executive or management member to expedite the resolution of this matter and find a flooring solution that aligns with the standards I have come to expect from Nebraska Furniture. Enclosed are pictures that illustrate the challenges my family has faced during this ordeal."

"Easy to view and search website to order from."
"Love this store and the delivery options "
"shopping. check out"
"Easy to work with, smooth process! "
"Good selection but when trying to checkout, the system was telling me my expiration date on my card was wrong, I had to resubmit like 5 times, then it finally accepted it. What a pain ðŸ˜ž hopefully delivery will be easier and the chairs I ordered will be worth it"
"The option to shop and order online and then pick my pick-up or delivery date.  The whole process was very easy and efficient. Berkshire prices were clearly marked and I appreciated the shareholder discount during this time period. "
"I love Nebraska furniture mart.They are amazing period I normally purchase things to be delivered to my house and if people that show up put the stuff together very quickly. They're also very friendly and the website is easy to use. Also the quality of the merchandise at nebraska furniture mart is the best in my opinion."

"24 month no interest financing really helps. Also, product cost is awesome. I would like more color options in leather recliner sofas  (grey please)"
"$100 store credit for damaged appliance. Had to pay over 30 bucks for shipping and handeling. What a crock! Probably will not shop with your store ever again!"
"Ease of transaction, I picked NFM for the mere fact the product is in stock and can be delivered free of charge, all great values and your pricing is comparable to other sites."

"I need a dishwasher like yesterday so thanks for having one in stock NFM"
"Everything that we tend to purchase from Nebraska Furniture mart is no longer available in the store.  We have to order it and then set up a time to get it delivered, or pick it up from the store, or in the case of smaller items delivered to our home.  Gone are the days that we could go to the store and purchase said item and leave the store with that item.  At this point since the items we are interested in are not in store, we have no motivation to go to the store location at all, thus causing the company to lose out on impulse purchases.  The online checkout process needs to be streamlined, and products need to be carried in the store.  NFM used to be a store we would travel to once a month and purchase something.  Now, it's a once or twice a year.  And maybe a few times more online.  "
"Easy online shopping, no-interest credit card, all around good experience each time."

"The order process overall was easy, but then when it came time to figure out using military discount they said I would need to do it over the phone and I got passed around to so many different people and then told I would just need to come into the store which currently I cannot do that because I'm at home on bed rest. There are plenty of companies out there that are third-party companies that verify military IDs and that whatever companies using them you can then apply to any purchases and I think it would be very helpful if this was something that Nebraska Furniture Mart had."
"Typical great service and value.I've been a satisfied customer for over 40 years! Thanks Bob Batt and family!"

"Berkshire Hathaway goods and services, a great NFM experience for sure!"

"Everything that we tend to purchase from Nebraska Furniture mart is no longer available in the store.  We have to order it and then set up a time to get it delivered, or pick it up from the store, or in the case of smaller items delivered to our home.  Gone are the days that we could go to the store and purchase said item and leave the store with that item.  At this point since the items we are interested in are not in store, we have no motivation to go to the store location at all, thus causing the company to lose out on impulse purchases.  The online checkout process needs to be streamlined, and products need to be carried in the store.  NFM used to be a store we would travel to once a month and purchase something.  Now, it's a once or twice a year.  And maybe a few times more online.  "

"The option to shop and order online and then pick my pick-up or delivery date.  The whole process was very easy and efficient. Berkshire prices were clearly marked and I appreciated the shareholder discount during this time period. "

There are plenty of companies out there that are third-party companies that verify military IDs and that whatever companies using them you can then apply to any purchases and I think it would be very helpful if this was something that Nebraska Furniture Mart had."

"I am writing to express my profound disappointment and dissatisfaction with the flooring work conducted by Nebraska Furniture. The experience my family and I have endured has been nothing short of frustrating and disheartening.Below is a detailed timeline of the events surrounding the flooring challenges we have faced:â€¢	July 12th: Flooring selection made, and the order promptly placed.â€¢	August 17th: Initial delivery scheduled (Order #78292892).â€¢	August 17th: Delivery received, and vinyl left to acclimate until August 21st.â€¢	August 21st: Project commenced; my family had to temporarily relocate due to construction.â€¢	August 23rd: Project put on hold due to a bad batch of materials.â€¢	August 25th: Informed of the issue and asked to select a new product.â€¢	August 28th: New material delivery scheduled.â€¢	August 28th: Second batch found to be defective.â€¢	September 8th: New color selected with assurances of expedited service.â€¢	September (ongoing): Numerous calls for updates, with a projected 10/17 delivery date.The frustration and inconvenience we have experienced throughout this process cannot be overstated. Our home has been in disarray for months, and the continual delays have taken a significant toll on us both mentally and emotionally.As a loyal customer of Nebraska Furniture since its establishment in Texas in 2015, and a card member for a similar duration, I have always valued the convenience and quality of your products. Over the years, I have purchased furniture for various rooms in my home without encountering any issues, except for the challenges faced during the COVID shutdown, which were understandable given global supply chain disruptions. I have even recommended your store to family and friends.Regrettably, despite providing this detailed account to the management team, I have not received a response. This lack of communication and resolution is deeply disappointing. At this point, I am left with no choice but NOT to do any further business with Nebraska Furniture. Furthermore, I intend to share my experience with everyone I know, as transparency regarding customer service is essential.I kindly request an immediate intervention from an executive or management member to expedite the resolution of this matter and find a flooring solution that aligns with the standards I have come to expect from Nebraska Furniture. Enclosed are pictures that illustrate the challenges my family has faced during this ordeal."

"Everything that we tend to purchase from Nebraska Furniture mart is no longer available in the store.  We have to order it and then set up a time to get it delivered, or pick it up from the store, or in the case of smaller items delivered to our home.  Gone are the days that we could go to the store and purchase said item and leave the store with that item.  At this point since the items we are interested in are not in store, we have no motivation to go to the store location at all, thus causing the company to lose out on impulse purchases.  The online checkout process needs to be streamlined, and products need to be carried in the store.  NFM used to be a store we would travel to once a month and purchase something.  Now, it's a once or twice a year.  And maybe a few times more online.  "

"I am writing to express my profound disappointment and dissatisfaction with the flooring work conducted by Nebraska Furniture. The experience my family and I have endured has been nothing short of frustrating and disheartening.Below is a detailed timeline of the events surrounding the flooring challenges we have faced:â€¢	July 12th: Flooring selection made, and the order promptly placed.â€¢	August 17th: Initial delivery scheduled (Order #78292892).â€¢	August 17th: Delivery received, and vinyl left to acclimate until August 21st.â€¢	August 21st: Project commenced; my family had to temporarily relocate due to construction.â€¢	August 23rd: Project put on hold due to a bad batch of materials.â€¢	August 25th: Informed of the issue and asked to select a new product.â€¢	August 28th: New material delivery scheduled.â€¢	August 28th: Second batch found to be defective.â€¢	September 8th: New color selected with assurances of expedited service.â€¢	September (ongoing): Numerous calls for updates, with a projected 10/17 delivery date.The frustration and inconvenience we have experienced throughout this process cannot be overstated. Our home has been in disarray for months, and the continual delays have taken a significant toll on us both mentally and emotionally.As a loyal customer of Nebraska Furniture since its establishment in Texas in 2015, and a card member for a similar duration, I have always valued the convenience and quality of your products. Over the years, I have purchased furniture for various rooms in my home without encountering any issues, except for the challenges faced during the COVID shutdown, which were understandable given global supply chain disruptions. I have even recommended your store to family and friends.Regrettably, despite providing this detailed account to the management team, I have not received a response. This lack of communication and resolution is deeply disappointing. At this point, I am left with no choice but NOT to do any further business with Nebraska Furniture. Furthermore, I intend to share my experience with everyone I know, as transparency regarding customer service is essential.I kindly request an immediate intervention from an executive or management member to expedite the resolution of this matter and find a flooring solution that aligns with the standards I have come to expect from Nebraska Furniture. Enclosed are pictures that illustrate the challenges my family has faced during this ordeal."

"Site is easy to navigate and the proct selection is awesome "
"Good selection but when trying to checkout, the system was telling me my expiration date on my card was wrong, I had to resubmit like 5 times, then it finally accepted it. What a pain ðŸ˜ž hopefully delivery will be easier and the chairs I ordered will be worth it"
"The option to shop and order online and then pick my pick-up or delivery date.  The whole process was very easy and efficient. Berkshire prices were clearly marked and I appreciated the shareholder discount during this time period. "
"I love Nebraska furniture mart.They are amazing period I normally purchase things to be delivered to my house and if people that show up put the stuff together very quickly.

"I need a dishwasher like yesterday so thanks for having one in stock NFM"
"Everything that we tend to purchase from Nebraska Furniture mart is no longer available in the store.  We have to order it and then set up a time to get it delivered, or pick it up from the store, or in the case of smaller items delivered to our home.  Gone are the days that we could go to the store and purchase said item and leave the store with that item.  At this point since the items we are interested in are not in store, we have no motivation to go to the store location at all, thus causing the company to lose out on impulse purchases.  The online checkout process needs to be streamlined, and products need to be carried in the store.  NFM used to be a store we would travel to once a month and purchase something.  Now, it's a once or twice a year.  And maybe a few times more online.  "

There are plenty of companies out there that are third-party companies that verify military IDs and that whatever companies using them you can then apply to any purchases and I think it would be very helpful if this was something that Nebraska Furniture Mart had."

"I am writing to express my profound disappointment and dissatisfaction with the flooring work conducted by Nebraska Furniture. The experience my family and I have endured has been nothing short of frustrating and disheartening.Below is a detailed timeline of the events surrounding the flooring challenges we have faced:â€¢	July 12th: Flooring selection made, and the order promptly placed.â€¢	August 17th: Initial delivery scheduled (Order #78292892).â€¢	August 17th: Delivery received, and vinyl left to acclimate until August 21st.â€¢	August 21st: Project commenced; my family had to temporarily relocate due to construction.â€¢	August 23rd: Project put on hold due to a bad batch of materials.â€¢	August 25th: Informed of the issue and asked to select a new product.â€¢	August 28th: New material delivery scheduled.â€¢	August 28th: Second batch found to be defective.â€¢	September 8th: New color selected with assurances of expedited service.â€¢	September (ongoing): Numerous calls for updates, with a projected 10/17 delivery date.The frustration and inconvenience we have experienced throughout this process cannot be overstated. Our home has been in disarray for months, and the continual delays have taken a significant toll on us both mentally and emotionally.As a loyal customer of Nebraska Furniture since its establishment in Texas in 2015, and a card member for a similar duration, I have always valued the convenience and quality of your products. Over the years, I have purchased furniture for various rooms in my home without encountering any issues, except for the challenges faced during the COVID shutdown, which were understandable given global supply chain disruptions. I have even recommended your store to family and friends.Regrettably, despite providing this detailed account to the management team, I have not received a response. This lack of communication and resolution is deeply disappointing. At this point, I am left with no choice but NOT to do any further business with Nebraska Furniture. Furthermore, I intend to share my experience with everyone I know, as transparency regarding customer service is essential.I kindly request an immediate intervention from an executive or management member to expedite the resolution of this matter and find a flooring solution that aligns with the standards I have come to expect from Nebraska Furniture. Enclosed are pictures that illustrate the challenges my family has faced during this ordeal."

"The option to shop and order online and then pick my pick-up or delivery date.  The whole process was very easy and efficient. Berkshire prices were clearly marked and I appreciated the shareholder discount during this time period. "
"I love Nebraska furniture mart.They are amazing period I normally purchase things to be delivered to my house and if people that show up put the stuff together very quickly.

"$100 store credit for damaged appliance. Had to pay over 30 bucks for shipping and handeling. What a crock! Probably will not shop with your store ever again!"

"I loved being able to see Berkshire pricing online during the event this year - sooooo much easier to shop knowing the price vs. having to call in."
"I need a dishwasher like yesterday so thanks for having one in stock NFM"
"Everything that we tend to purchase from Nebraska Furniture mart is no longer available in the store.  We have to order it and then set up a time to get it delivered, or pick it up from the store, or in the case of smaller items delivered to our home.  Gone are the days that we could go to the store and purchase said item and leave the store with that item.  At this point since the items we are interested in are not in store, we have no motivation to go to the store location at all, thus causing the company to lose out on impulse purchases.  The online checkout process needs to be streamlined, and products need to be carried in the store.  NFM used to be a store we would travel to once a month and purchase something.  Now, it's a once or twice a year.  And maybe a few times more online.  "

"I am always  able  to easily  find what I am  looking for to  make a  quick purchase. Every time I order, my items are always in stock, and I receive them quickly. "
"Had it in stock, fast delivery options, easy to purchase"
"The order process overall was easy, but then when it came time to figure out using military discount they said I would need to do it over the phone and I got passed around to so many different people and then told I would just need to come into the store which currently I cannot do that because I'm at home on bed rest. There are plenty of companies out there that are third-party companies that verify military IDs and that whatever companies using them you can then apply to any purchases and I think it would be very helpful if this was something that Nebraska Furniture Mart had."
"Typical great service and value.I've been a satisfied customer for over 40 years! Thanks Bob Batt and family!"

"Berkshire Hathaway goods and services, a great NFM experience for sure!"

"Everything that we tend to purchase from Nebraska Furniture mart is no longer available in the store.  We have to order it and then set up a time to get it delivered, or pick it up from the store, or in the case of smaller items delivered to our home.  Gone are the days that we could go to the store and purchase said item and leave the store with that item.  At this point since the items we are interested in are not in store, we have no motivation to go to the store location at all, thus causing the company to lose out on impulse purchases.  The online checkout process needs to be streamlined, and products need to be carried in the store.  NFM used to be a store we would travel to once a month and purchase something.  Now, it's a once or twice a year.  And maybe a few times more online.  "

"I am writing to express my profound disappointment and dissatisfaction with the flooring work conducted by Nebraska Furniture. The experience my family and I have endured has been nothing short of frustrating and disheartening.Below is a detailed timeline of the events surrounding the flooring challenges we have faced:â€¢	July 12th: Flooring selection made, and the order promptly placed.â€¢	August 17th: Initial delivery scheduled (Order #78292892).â€¢	August 17th: Delivery received, and vinyl left to acclimate until August 21st.â€¢	August 21st: Project commenced; my family had to temporarily relocate due to construction.â€¢	August 23rd: Project put on hold due to a bad batch of materials.â€¢	August 25th: Informed of the issue and asked to select a new product.â€¢	August 28th: New material delivery scheduled.â€¢	August 28th: Second batch found to be defective.â€¢	September 8th: New color selected with assurances of expedited service.â€¢	September (ongoing): Numerous calls for updates, with a projected 10/17 delivery date.The frustration and inconvenience we have experienced throughout this process cannot be overstated. Our home has been in disarray for months, and the continual delays have taken a significant toll on us both mentally and emotionally.As a loyal customer of Nebraska Furniture since its establishment in Texas in 2015, and a card member for a similar duration, I have always valued the convenience and quality of your products. Over the years, I have purchased furniture for various rooms in my home without encountering any issues, except for the challenges faced during the COVID shutdown, which were understandable given global supply chain disruptions. I have even recommended your store to family and friends.Regrettably, despite providing this detailed account to the management team, I have not received a response. This lack of communication and resolution is deeply disappointing. At this point, I am left with no choice but NOT to do any further business with Nebraska Furniture. Furthermore, I intend to share my experience with everyone I know, as transparency regarding customer service is essential.I kindly request an immediate intervention from an executive or management member to expedite the resolution of this matter and find a flooring solution that aligns with the standards I have come to expect from Nebraska Furniture. Enclosed are pictures that illustrate the challenges my family has faced during this ordeal."

"Everything that we tend to purchase from Nebraska Furniture mart is no longer available in the store.  We have to order it and then set up a time to get it delivered, or pick it up from the store, or in the case of smaller items delivered to our home.  Gone are the days that we could go to the store and purchase said item and leave the store with that item.  At this point since the items we are interested in are not in store, we have no motivation to go to the store location at all, thus causing the company to lose out on impulse purchases.  The online checkout process needs to be streamlined, and products need to be carried in the store.  NFM used to be a store we would travel to once a month and purchase something.  Now, it's a once or twice a year.  And maybe a few times more online.  "

There are plenty of companies out there that are third-party companies that verify military IDs and that whatever companies using them you can then apply to any purchases and I think it would be very helpful if this was something that Nebraska Furniture Mart had."

"I am writing to express my profound disappointment and dissatisfaction with the flooring work conducted by Nebraska Furniture. The experience my family and I have endured has been nothing short of frustrating and disheartening.Below is a detailed timeline of the events surrounding the flooring challenges we have faced:â€¢	July 12th: Flooring selection made, and the order promptly placed.â€¢	August 17th: Initial delivery scheduled (Order #78292892).â€¢	August 17th: Delivery received, and vinyl left to acclimate until August 21st.â€¢	August 21st: Project commenced; my family had to temporarily relocate due to construction.â€¢	August 23rd: Project put on hold due to a bad batch of materials.â€¢	August 25th: Informed of the issue and asked to select a new product.â€¢	August 28th: New material delivery scheduled.â€¢	August 28th: Second batch found to be defective.â€¢	September 8th: New color selected with assurances of expedited service.â€¢	September (ongoing): Numerous calls for updates, with a projected 10/17 delivery date.The frustration and inconvenience we have experienced throughout this process cannot be overstated. Our home has been in disarray for months, and the continual delays have taken a significant toll on us both mentally and emotionally.As a loyal customer of Nebraska Furniture since its establishment in Texas in 2015, and a card member for a similar duration, I have always valued the convenience and quality of your products. Over the years, I have purchased furniture for various rooms in my home without encountering any issues, except for the challenges faced during the COVID shutdown, which were understandable given global supply chain disruptions. I have even recommended your store to family and friends.Regrettably, despite providing this detailed account to the management team, I have not received a response. This lack of communication and resolution is deeply disappointing. At this point, I am left with no choice but NOT to do any further business with Nebraska Furniture. Furthermore, I intend to share my experience with everyone I know, as transparency regarding customer service is essential.I kindly request an immediate intervention from an executive or management member to expedite the resolution of this matter and find a flooring solution that aligns with the standards I have come to expect from Nebraska Furniture. Enclosed are pictures that illustrate the challenges my family has faced during this ordeal."
